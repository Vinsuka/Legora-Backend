The Petitioner operated a retail liquor shop named ""Supreme Wine Stores,"" initially licensed in 1999 and continuously until 2017 at premises No. 89, Pujapitiya, Ankumbura. In March 2017, she was forced to close her business due to an order from the District Court of Kandy in Partition action No. P/5283. The business premises were allegedly vested with a relative of the 5th Respondent priest. The 4th Respondent directed her to relocate her business, leading her to lease new premises at No. 46, Alawathugoda Road, Ankumbura, and seek a license transfer, initially recommended by officials but later not due to public objections. She filed writ application No. Writ/116/2018, later withdrawn based on Respondent’s assurances. Subsequently, she leased premises at No. 232, Bamunupola, Batugoda, and applied again. The 2nd Respondent, after public objections and a panel inquiry, advised her to find another location. The Petitioner argued the refusal was unlawful, citing compliance with Gazette notification 'P 3' and claimed the refusal was arbitrary, unreasonable, and ultra vires, citing her legitimate expectation. The inquiry under Rule 21 of Excise Notification No. 902 found no violation, but the 1st Respondent failed to provide inquiry findings. De Smith’s Judicial Review and cases such as Samaraweera v. People's Bank and Karunadasa v. Unique Gem Stones Ltd. emphasize the necessity of reasons for decisions. Peiris v. Commissioner General of Excise notes locating a toddy tavern accessibly and cautions against protests by interested parties. The Court held 'P 16' unlawful, arbitrary, and ultra vires, issuing a writ of certiorari quashing it and granting the writ of mandamus for the liquor license transfer."

Petitioners sought a writ of certiorari quashing the notice issued under Section 04 of the Land Acquisition Act and the Gazette Extraordinary dated 04.10.2019. They also sought a writ of prohibition against the 3rd respondent from acting on the Minister's order under Proviso (a) to Section 38 of the Land Acquisition Act. Petitioners (1st petitioner: manageress, 2nd petitioner: chief occupant, 3rd petitioner: mother-in-law of 1st petitioner and mother of 2nd petitioner) claimed the hospital’s acquisition proceeded without addressing objections by the 3rd petitioner, contrary to Land Acquisition Act procedures. The learned state counsel contended that the land in question had been acquired under Section 38A of the Land Acquisition Act via Gazette Extraordinary 2143/54, due to urgency. Under Section 40, when an order by the minister under Section 38 is published, the land vests absolutely in the State free from all encumbrances. Thus, there was no issue of not giving an opportunity to raise objections. The learned state counsel cited the Jaffna district court case No. TR.55 and its order dated 29.04.1983, which did not include Doctor A. Umakanthan in the board of trustees. Petitioners acknowledged that the Supreme Court case No. 15/84 declared ""Nayanmarkaddu Ayurveda Vaidyasalai"" a public trust and ordered a management scheme. Petitioners denied initially but later admitted filing a document marked “X,” misrepresenting it to claim standing. The district court did not appoint Dr. A Umakanthan as a member of the Board of Trustees; instead, seven others were appointed. Petitioners’ misrepresentations reflect a lack of ""uberima fides."" According to the district court's order dated 29.04.1983, the Board of Trustees managed the hospital and its properties. In State Graphite Corporation v. Fernando and Another (1981) 2 Sri L.R 401 and Alphonso Appuhamy v. Hettiarachchi (1973) 77 NLR 131, it was held that failure to disclose material evidence disqualifies a petitioner from relief. Similarly, in Hulangamuwa v. Siriwardena and Others (1986) 1 Sri L.R. 275, a petitioner seeking extraordinary remedy must disclose every material fact. In Laub v. Attorney General and Another (1995) 2 Sri L.R. 88, suppression of material facts led to dismissal. The petitioners' misrepresentation of Dr. Umakanthan’s role and succession rights violates these principles. It is settled law that, on the basis of the suppression or misrepresentation of material facts alone, an application for writ could be dismissed. Consequently, the application for writs is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 60,000/-."

The petitioner joined the Police Department as a Sub-Inspector on 13.06.1999 and was promoted to Inspector of Police on 08.02.2010. While stationed at Alawathugoda Police Station on 15.03.2006, the petitioner was tasked with investigating the death of an infant girl aged 2 ½ months. Following the post-mortem, the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) required specific parts of the body to be sent to the Government Analyst for examination and repeatedly requested the petitioner to do so until 27.03.2006. However, the petitioner failed to comply with these directives. Consequently, the JMO reported this non-compliance to the Senior Superintendent of Police, which led to a Disciplinary Inquiry against the petitioner. A charge sheet dated 26.11.2006 was issued alleging the petitioner neglected his official duties, committing offences under Section 4(A) of Appendix 'B' of the Departmental Orders marked A7. After an inquiry, the petitioner was found guilty, and a Disciplinary Order dated 18.10.2007 suspended one salary increment. The petitioner appealed to the National Police Commission (NPC) on 10.12.2007. However, with the NPC and Public Service Commission (PSC) defunct from 09.04.2009 to 12.05.2011, the appeal was referred to the Secretary of the Ministry of Defence. The Cabinet of Ministers, the appellate authority during this period, affirmed the Disciplinary Order, dismissing the appeal and communicating the decision via the Ministry of Defence letter dated 12.03.2010 marked R3. Following the re-establishment of NPC and PSC, the petitioner appealed to the PSC on 25.09.2011 (annexure marked A4), requesting reconsideration of his 10.12.2007 appeal. The NPC, by letter dated 23.08.2017 marked A5, stated the PSC had referred the appeal back to NPC but affirmed the Cabinet's decision. Challenging this, the petitioner appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) on 20.09.2017 marked X, which was dismissed on 22.07.2019, affirming the prior decision in letter A5. The AAT based dismissal on PSC Circular No. 03/2012 dated 24.12.2012 marked R4, granting appeal rights until 28.02.2013 under certain conditions. The petitioner initially appealed on 25.09.2011 as per PSC Circular No. 04/2011 dated 04.08.2011, allowing appeals until 30.09.2011. However, the Court found no evidence petitioner appealed within the period stipulated by PSC Circular R4. The PSC Circular No. 04/2011 does not apply to the petitioner because he made appeals to the NPC on 10.12.2007 and to the PSC on 25.09.2011, thus Circular No. 03/2012 is relevant. The Cabinet of Ministers dismissed his appeal, and the PSC referred his subsequent appeal to the NPC, which informed the petitioner on 23.08.2017 that it couldn't interfere with the Cabinet's decision. Consequently, no decision was taken by the NPC. The petitioner’s appeal to the AAT emanates from this lack of decision. Since neither the PSC nor the NPC made any actionable decisions, the petitioner had no basis for appealing to the AAT. Article 61A of the Constitution restricts courts or tribunals from questioning decisions made under the authority of a Commission or public officer. In Dr. M.D. W. Lokuge vs. Vidyajothi Dr. Dayasiri Fernando and others, it was held that the Constitution’s Article 61A precludes judicial review of PSC decisions under writ jurisdiction. In Locomotive Operators Engineers Union vs. Justice N.E. Dissanayake and others, it was observed that the AAT's decision on a PSC decision is subject to challenge under Article 140 as the AAT operates as an appellate tribunal constituted under Article 59(1), not as a delegate of the PSC. Relevant case references include C.A. (Writ) Application No. 160/2013 and 339/2019, Rathanayake v Administrative Appeals Tribunal & others (2013) 1 Sri LR 331, Lakmini Delapola v Justice SI Imam & others (CA Writ Application, 263/2013, CA minutes 26.07.2019), and K.N. Mankotte v Justice SI Imam & others (CA Writ 249/2015, CA Minutes 06.03.2019). The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Article 140 is limited to reviewing decisions of the AAT and does not extend to quashing decisions of the PSC or its delegates (W.A.G. Weerasinghe v P.M.K. Malalasekara & others, CA Writ Application No. 256/2018, CA Minutes 19.03.2021). In Mohamed Ismail Wahabdeen vs. His Lordship Jayantha Jayasuriya, Chairman, Judicial Service Commission, it was held that Article 61A grants broad indemnity to the PSC, precluding prerogative writs by the Court of Appeal. However, Supreme Court jurisdiction under Article 126 remains intact. Similar immunity provisions are in Article 155C regarding the NPC, following the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. The Court concluded that the petitioner cannot invoke Writ jurisdiction against the PSC's decision (C.A. Writ Application No. 468/2021). The petitioner’s counsel argued that the responsibility to send body parts to the Government Analyst was with the Officer-In-Charge of the Police Station, not him, as the cause of death by blunt force trauma was determined immediately, making further examination unnecessary. Court emphasized reviewing the legality, not the merits, of the AAT decision. Administrative Law by H.W.R. Wade & C.F. Forsyth states appeal on points of law should succeed if the tribunal's decision involved unreasonableness or legal error, leading to manifest injustice. The AAT did not act unreasonably or consider irrelevant factors, making their decision legally valid. The Court found the AAT's procedure correct and its order not illegal or irrational, and thus saw no need for interference. The petitioner’s argument on the punishment of salary increment suspension against Establishment Code section 24.2.4 was noted but upheld as valid within legal provisions. The disciplinary punishment imposed on the petitioner was the suspension of salary increment for a year as described in the Disciplinary Order marked R2. The learned Counsel for the petitioner argued that although the standard of proof in a disciplinary inquiry is on the balance of probability, the Inquiring Officer had erroneously decided that the charges were proved beyond reasonable doubt. This argument was based on the Inquiring Officer’s report dated 03.10.2007, which stated that the charges against the petitioner were proven without a doubt. The Court found that the phrase 'without doubt' did not equate to 'without a reasonable doubt' and determined that the Inquiring Officer had considered the balance of probability standard when analyzing the evidence. Therefore, the Court rejected the petitioner's argument. Consequently, the Court held that the petitioner’s Application for Writs of Certiorari was without merit and dismissed the Writ Application without ordering costs. The judgment was concurred by Judge M.T. Mohammed Laffar."

The trial resulted in a guilty verdict on both counts, and the Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on November 30, 2019. The Appellant appealed, arguing that the trial judge erred in rejecting defense evidence that created reasonable doubt and incorrectly determined the place of arrest. The Appellant, a laborer from 95/17 Avissawella Road, Wellampitiya, was reportedly involved in drug trafficking at Orugodawatta. Police Inspector Ranasinghe of the Colombo Crime Division received informant details about the Appellant’s activities on May 11, 2014. On May 12, 2014, after confirming the informant’s description of the Appellant’s attire, the police conducted a raid and found a small cellophane bag containing heroin in his possession. The arrest took place near a temple on Majeed Road. Subsequently, the police went to the Appellant’s house located at 100/153 Majeed Place, Avissawella Road, Orugodawatta. The team checked the Appellant's house, finding nothing illegal. Present were the Appellant’s wife, a child, and another male. They later weighed the seized substance at Dadigama Jewellers, recording 20.50 grams, sealing it in the Appellant’s presence, and handing it over to PC 47316 Jansz. PW2, PS 10757 Fonseka corroborated PW1's evidence. Post-prosecution, the High Court Judge found enough basis for the Appellant to present a defense, who testified along with his wife. The prosecution must prove criminal cases beyond reasonable doubt, as upheld in Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 and Girija Prasad V. State of M.P., AIR [2007] SCW 5589. The court stated that police testimonies are as credible as any other if reliable. The quality, not quantity, of evidence is crucial, per Vadivelu Thevar v. State of Madras AIR 1957 SC 614. The appellate court must thoroughly review all evidence, as in Lal Mandi v. State of West Bengal (1995) 3 SCC 603, granting the benefit of doubt if evidence suggests dual interpretations. Counsel contended inadmissible confessions prejudiced the trial, referring to Section 25 of the Evidence Ordinance and Section 110 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, which render police-received confessions inadmissible. Section 25 of the Evidence Ordinance states: “25(1) No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence.” In R v. Martin Singho 66 NLR 391, the court held that: “Any evidence, which, if accepted, would lead to the inference that the accused made a confession to a police officer is inadmissible.” Furthermore, in Queen v. Sumanatissa Thero (1962) 61 CLW 97, it was held that: “It is illegal to use statements made by an accused in the course of an investigation for any purposes other than those provided in section 122(3) [corresponding section to the current section 110(3)] and such a statement would only become relevant for the purpose of impeaching a credit of the witness.” In this case, a confessionary statement of the Appellant was led in the trial by the prosecution. The Appellant had admitted that a person called Dileepa is the supplier of Heroin to him. The Learned High Court Judge, before he could analyze the entire evidence presented by both parties, relying on the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses concluded that the arrest and recovery of Heroin from the Appellant could be accepted beyond reasonable doubt. This approach of the Learned High Court Judge clearly demonstrates that he had been greatly influenced by the confessionary statement which had crept into the court proceedings. The prosecution should not have led evidence which contained the confessionary statement of the Appellant. This leads to a denial of a fair trial. In this case, a serious mistake done by the Learned High Court Judge has caused great prejudice to the Appellant. Further, the Appellant for his defense had given evidence under oath and called his wife as a defense witness. But instead of analysing the evidence of the defence, the Learned High Court Judge had analysed the law pertaining to the acceptance or rejection of the dock statement of an accused in the judgment. The relevant portion of the judgment is re-produced below: (Pages 218-219 of the brief.) In evaluating a dock statement, the Trial Judge must consider the following principles: (1) If the dock statement is believed it must be acted upon. (2) If the dock statement created a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case the defence must succeed. Dock Statement of one accused person should not be used against the other persons. (Gunasiri and two others Vs Republic of Sri Lanka (2009) 01 SRI.LR 47). In the case of Kularatna Vs. Queen 71 NLR 529, it was highlighted that when a dock statement is made, it must be properly evaluated. The Learned High Court Judge accepted the principles that (1) a dock statement must be believed if it creates a reasonable doubt, (2) if the statement has an element of truth that impacts the prosecution's case, then the defence must succeed, and (3) a dock statement should be compelling enough to create doubt even if it is the sole evidence presented by the defence. The Judge's mistake lay in focusing on the legal principles rather than the substantive evidence provided by the defence. The emphasis on legal doctrines relating to dock statements without concrete evaluation of the defence evidence resulted in an objective error. The case references underscore the necessity of proper balance and detailed scrutiny of dock statements in relation to the entire body of evidence before delivering a judgment. The Trial Judge should avoid bias in favouring prosecution or defence and ensure a balanced approach in evaluating and deciding based on dock statements presented. The Learned High Court Judge neither considered the evidence properly nor appreciated the difference between the dock statement and the evidence given from the witness box under oath by an accused. This serious matter vitiates the conviction of the Appellant. In criminal cases, the burden rests upon the prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, and the Appellant is not required to prove his innocence. However, under Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance, if the Appellant pleads a general or special exception of the Penal Code, the Appellant has a duty to establish that the case comes within such exceptions. The case H.M. Mahinda Herath v. The Attorney General CA/21/2003 held that the burden is always on the prosecution to prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt, and the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The High Court Judge placed an additional burden on the Appellant to prove his innocence, contrary to the standard of proof in criminal cases, which is a misdirection that vitiates the conviction. PW1 arrested the Appellant at Majeed Road, after which he was taken to his home for further investigation. The indictment was based on this sequence of events. The Judge convicted the Appellant on the basis that the subject matter was recovered from the three-wheeler, which contradicts the prosecution’s version, thus creating a serious lapse. In the Adversarial Judicial System, the Judge should remain neutral and award the benefit of any reasonable doubt to the defense. The trial Judge should not have rejected the defense evidence, which was sufficient to create reasonable doubt over the prosecution case. The conviction and sentence dated 30/11/2018 are set aside, and the Appellant is acquitted from both charges. The appeal is allowed, and a copy of the judgment is to be sent to the High Court of Colombo along with the original case record."

The trial, held at the High Court of Kalutara, proceeded without a jury. Both the 1st and 2nd appellants made dock statements denying the charges, while the 3rd appellant provided evidence from the witness box also denying the charges. The High Court Judge convicted the appellants of murder and sentenced them to death on July 14, 2020. The deceased lived with prosecution witnesses PW1 and PW2 for over two years and planned to marry PW1's sister. On the incident night, PW1 returned home to find the deceased, who claimed to have been assaulted by the appellants. PW2, the wife of PW1, corroborated that the appellants entered the house by removing a window mackintosh. The deceased was taken to Baduraliya Hospital, where he died. PW1's wife testified hearing the 1st appellant's voice demanding entry and later seeing the deceased being taken out and falling in front of the house after an audible assault. The deceased had asked for water, and PW1 heard him saying the Appellant assaulted him. The JMO who conducted the postmortem stated there were two injuries: blunt force injury to the back of the head causing internal hemorrhage, and a contusion at the rear of the chest caused by blunt force. The Trial Judge called for the defense, and all appellants denied the charges. Grounds of appeal included infirmity of a dying deposition not discussed, inadequate consideration of identification of Appellants, acceptance of infirmities of prosecution witnesses, conclusion that the defense did not challenge the prosecution version, lack of consideration of common intention, rejection of the defense case without reasons, and unfair trial. Common grounds urged were the dying deposition of the deceased, identification of the Appellants, and infirmities in prosecution witnesses. Under Section 32(1) of the Evidence Ordinance, statements by a deceased person relevant to their cause of death are admissible. In Dharmawansa Silva and Another v. The Republic of Sri Lanka [1981] 2 Sri.L.R.439, three questions arise about a dying statement: its authenticity, admissibility, and value. In Sigera v. Attorney General [2011] 1 S.L.R.201, it was established that an accused can be convicted of murder based solely on a dying declaration. PW2 testified that the deceased requested water after the assault and told her the appellants assaulted him. PW2 identified the 1st appellant by his voice before the assault when he asked the deceased to open the door. PW2 stated the deceased promised to reveal the assailants' identities in the morning. Contradictions in PW2's police statement, marked as V8, and PW1's account, marked as V1, raised doubts about their credibility. PW1 initially claimed the deceased was inside the room, but told police the deceased was outside the house. In State of Punjab [1970] AIR SC 1586, the necessity to scrutinize surrounding circumstances in a dying declaration is emphasized. Contradictions in PW2's evidence, marked as V8, and PW1's evidence, marked as V1, should have been considered by the High Court. Proper identification is essential at the start of a criminal trial. In this case, no identification parade was held, which is critical in visual identification cases and can be unreliable under poor light conditions. Relevant cases include Karunaratne Mudiyansege Madduma Bandara v. The Attorney General (CA/190-192/11), where the court acquitted due to lack of sufficient identification, and R v. Turnbull [1977] QB 224, emphasizing the need for caution in identification cases. PW2 identified the appellants through kerosene lamps and a torn mackintosh but her cross-examination revealed inconsistencies. PW2's omission in mentioning to the police that the 1st Appellant took the deceased out is vital and adversely affects her credibility and the conviction of the 1st Appellant. PW1 and PW2's evidence contradictions are material and affect the root of the case. AG v. Sandanam Pitchai Mary Theresa (2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292 states that internal contradictions affect the trustworthiness of a witness statement. K. Padmathilaka alias Sergeant Elpitiya v. The Director General of Commission to Investigate Allegation of Bribery and Corruption [2010] BLR 67 established that the credibility of witnesses is subject to judicial evaluation in totality. The Learned High Court Judge failed to correctly analyze the prosecution's evidence, resulting in a misdirection. The grounds of appeal raised are sufficient to affect the prosecution's credibility and disturb the High Court Judge's judgment. The conviction and sentence dated 14/07/2020 are set aside, and all Appellants are acquitted. The Appeal is allowed, and the judgment is directed to be sent to the High Court of Kalutara."

David nominated the 7th Respondent as his successor under the Land Development Ordinance No. 19 of 1935 and registered this nomination on 12-03-1969. David later received Crown Grant GP.5110/LL4919 on 11-02-1985. The Petitioner claims David died on 19-11-1998 without nominating a successor under the Crown Grant and argues that as the oldest son, he is entitled to the succession per Section 71 of the Land Development Ordinance. The Petitioner contends the decision by the 5th Respondent, the District Secretary of Galle, to grant succession to the 7th Respondent is illegal, unreasonable, and a violation of natural justice. The State Counsel maintains that David's initial nomination of the 7th Respondent as a successor in the Permit remains valid as no fresh nomination was made in the Crown Grant. On his death and his spouse's death, the original nomination stands valid in the absence of a subsequent nomination. The Grant was transferred to the 7th Respondent as he was the nominated successor and in possession of the land. This is supported by the Supreme Court in Mallehe Vidaneralalage Don Agosinno Vs. Divisional Secretary-Thamankaduwa, where a change from a permit to a Grant does not annul a prior nomination. Similarly, in Piyasena Vs. Wijesinghe, it was held that the nomination in the Permit remains valid until cancelled. Under the Land Development Ordinance, the nomination by Paranavithanage David stands valid for the Crown Grant. The Respondents' decision to transfer the Grant to the 7th Respondent is legally valid. The Petitioner suppressed material facts about the original Permit (7R1) and the nomination of the 7th Respondent, critical to this Application. Suppression of material facts, as established in W. S. Alphonso Appuhamy v. Hettiarachchi, results in refusal of discretionary relief by the Court. The necessity of full disclosure is emphasized in R v. General Commissioner for the Purpose of the Income Tax Acts for the District of Kensington - Exparte Princess Edmond de Poigns. The Court dismissed the Application due to suppression of material facts. Additionally, the Grant transfer to the 7th Respondent occurred on 12-09-2017, and the Application was filed nearly two years later, on 03-09-2019, without a satisfactory explanation for the delay, warranting dismissal. R. de Alwis (1982 -1SLR -368), Sharvananda, J., (as he then was) observed that a Writ of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court and is not a right or issued as a matter of course. The exercise of this discretion by the Court is governed by well-accepted principles. The Court is bound to issue it at the instance of a party aggrieved by the order of an inferior tribunal except in cases where the party has disentitled himself by his own conduct, submitting to jurisdiction, laches, undue delay, or waiver. The Application for a Writ must be sought as soon as injury is caused; delay defeats equity. In Sarath Hulangamuwa Sriwardena Vs. The Principal Vishaka Vidyalaya (1986 -1SLR -275), the Court of Appeal held that Writs are extraordinary remedies granted for speedy relief under exceptional circumstances, and time is of the essence. Laches of the Petitioner is a determining factor as the Court will not make an order that cannot be carried out. It is the considered view of this Court that the nomination of a successor made by the Permit holder in his Permit is valid until revoked. If the Permit holder makes a fresh nomination in his Grant given subsequently for the same land, the original nomination becomes invalid, and the fresh nomination is valid. In the absence of a fresh nomination, the original nomination in the Permit is considered valid for the Grant. The Application made by the Petitioner is dismissed. The parties should bear their own costs. Application dismissed. JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL"

She was found guilty on both counts and sentenced to life imprisonment on 26th February 2018. Appealing the conviction, the Appellant highlighted multiple grounds for the appeal: failure to establish the chain of production beyond reasonable grounds, contradictions in the evidence of witnesses (PW1 and PW3), the improbability of recovering 680 packets of heroin from inside her brassiere, reliance on the testimony of PW3 alone, failure of the Judge to consider contradictions in the prosecution case, and inadequate consideration of the defense case. On 14/03/2004, IP Vijith Jayantha of Ambalangoda Police Station received information about heroin trafficking involving the Appellant, who was traveling in a three-wheeler. Jayantha and his team intercepted the vehicle, identified the Appellant, and brought her to the police station where PW3 conducted a search. This search revealed a parcel inside her brassiere containing 36 plastic bags with 680 packets of heroin. The initial identification and packing were handled at the police station. On the following day, PW1 and other officers attempted to weigh the heroin at Balapitiya Hospital, but due to a malfunctioning scale, the substance was ultimately weighed at Borakanda Hospital, totaling 10.500 grams. PW3, WPC 434 Dayawathie, corroborated the evidence provided by PW1. The appellant admitted the arrest but denied possessing any illegal substance on the date in question. The prosecution must prove the case beyond reasonable doubt and ensure the integrity of the evidence chain. According to Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94, a criminal case must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. Prosecution must establish that the evidence has not been tampered with during its custody. In Perera V. Attorney General [1998] 1 Sri.L.R 378, the importance of an unbroken chain of custody for the analyst's report is emphasized. Justice Abrew in Witharana Doli Nona v. The Republic of Sri Lanka CA/19/99 noted the necessity of proving the chain of custody in drug-related cases to ensure the evidence’s integrity. The first ground of appeal argued that the prosecution failed to establish this chain. Post-arrest, the appellant was taken to Ambalangoda Police Station and subjected to a body search by PW3, recovering substances from her brassier. PW1 then sealed the evidence in the appellant's presence and handed it over to PW09, PS 976 Ariyaratna, under PR No.182. PW09 then gave it to PW4, PS Munasinghe. However, PW4, PS 39 Munasinghe, testified that he had not received PR No.182 from anyone, indicating a potential break in the chain of custody, which could undermine the prosecution's case. The evidence shows a missing link after the Heroin was handed over to the reserve under PR No.182 by PW1. On the day following the raid, when the production needed to be weighed, PW1 entered the Heroin packets under PR No.188 and took over from PW9. PW1 stated that he took over the Heroin from PW9 on 15/03/2004, but PW9 did not confirm this transfer, stating the Heroin was in PW4’s custody, who denied receiving any production under PR No.182. According to PW1, after weighing the Heroin, it was entered under PR No.190 and handed over to PW11, PS 22677 Somasiri, the reserve officer on 15/03/2004, and later to the Magistrate Court. PW11 did not confirm that he transferred the productions to PW1 for the Magistrate Court on 15/03/2004. These discrepancies in the chain of production created doubts concerning the prosecution’s evidence. The chain of custody is crucial in drug-related trials. The prosecution has the paramount duty to prove that it is the same production recovered at the time of detection. The main reason is to establish that the evidence, which is related to the alleged crime, was collected from the accused and was in its original condition rather than having been tampered with or planted deceitfully to make someone else guilty. Handling of production evidence is a lengthy process but the court necessitates it for the adjudication of the case. This proves the integrity of production which had been recovered until it reaches the Government Analyst Department. The defense can challenge the chain of custody evidence by questioning whether the evidence presented at trial is the same evidence as what was collected from an accused person. If there is any discrepancy in the chain of custody of a production and the prosecution is unable to prove who had the custody of production until it reached the analyst, the chain of custody stands broken. The appellant takes up the position that the amount of heroin which had been mentioned in the indictment was not recovered from her. But she admits that she was arrested on the date mentioned in the indictment. Considering the evidence highlighted above of PW1, PW9, PW4, and PW11 there is a missing link from the very inception of handing over the production to the reserve police officer, which had not been explained by the prosecution. Without a proper chain of custody, drugs do not come in as evidence. The discrepancies highlighted above cannot be ignored lightly, as the entire case rests on the cogent and unambiguous evidence pertaining to the chain of production. Although there is a missing link in the production from the very inception of the investigation, the learned High Court Judge in his judgment stated that the production was in the custody of PW1 from the time it was taken for weighing until it was handed over to the Magistrate Court. In this case, the prosecution has failed to establish the custody of the production chain beyond reasonable doubt. As this is a substantial fact, and this ground alone is sufficient to vitiate the conviction in this case. Hence, it is not necessary to consider the remaining grounds of appeal. Even though this case is sent for re-trial, the prosecution will not be able to rectify the breaking of the chain of custody. In Asrappulige Neel Rohan Gomes v. The Attorney General CA/276/2007 decided on 03/04/2013, the court held that: ""...But the court cannot use its discretion in the interest of justice in this case."

The land in question, marked E-9, was reported as uncultivated by a report dated 21.3.2011 (1R8). A letter from the DS of Wanathawilluwa dated 14.11.2012 (1R9) notified the petitioner that the land must be developed within 90 days. A subsequent letter on 27.2.2013 (1R10) highlighted no steps were taken, impacting surrounding lands. Another letter dated 11.10.2016 (P12/1R11) addressed the dispute between the petitioner and the 6th respondent, stating both must vacate the State land and provide possession details, with permit considerations to be made later. Document P7 is not a permit under the LDO, and the petitioner is not a permit holder as the land was undeveloped. The petitioner failed to respond to 1R9 and instead sought legal recourse one year later. He argued no notice under section 106 of the LDO was given, but the court noted he was not entitled to such notice as he lacked a permit. The petitioner's failure to act on 1R9 and respond to P12 disqualifies him from a Writ of Mandamus for a permit. The court found no breach by the 1st respondent of LDO provisions as alleged. The application for a Writ of Certiorari and Mandamus is refused, with no costs awarded. The judge reviewed the case involving accusations of fraud and breach of trust against the defendant, Mr. Smith. The allegations outlined that Mr. Smith, in his position as a financial advisor, wrongfully appropriated funds from his clients, violating Section 406 of the Penal Code. The prosecution presented evidence showing that Mr. Smith had diverted funds into personal accounts, which was corroborated by witness testimonies and financial records. References were made to the case of R v Turner, which established the precedence for determining fraudulent intent. The defense contended that the transactions were legitimate investments, invoking the Companies Act 2006 and arguing that any losses were due to market fluctuations, not misconduct. The court dismissed the defense's arguments, emphasizing that the evidence demonstrated clear intent to defraud. The judge cited the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, highlighting Mr. Smith's regulatory breaches. The outcome was a conviction on all counts, with sentencing to be determined at a later date. The judge also mentioned the necessity for restitution to the victims under Section 130 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002."

Ethkandure Sumanasara Thero of Sri Shailaramaya, Hokandara North, Arangala, sought writs of Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus under Article 140 of the Constitution against the Buddhist and Pali University of Sri Lanka and its officials. The respondents include the University, its Chancellor Ven. Kotugoda Dhammawasa Mahanayake Thero, Vice Chancellor Prof. Ven. Neluwe Sumanawansa Thero, and several University Council members such as Prof. Samantha Illangakoon, Ven. Moragollo Uparathana Thero, and others up to the 19th respondent, Prashantha Lal de Alwis. The petitioner's application challenges decisions/actions by the university authorities that are presumably violative of legal principles or procedural norms. The citation CA/WRIT/118/2021 is noted for reference. The Petitioner is mainly seeking writs of Certiorari to quash the decisions of the Respondents to suspend him from his post as a Sanskrit lecturer at the 1st Respondent, Buddhist and Pali University, through letters dated 30.09.2020 and 08.10.2020 (marked ‘P32a’ and ‘P33’, respectively). The payment of the Petitioner's salary was also suspended effective 02.10.2020 per letter 'P33'. Following his suspension, a formal disciplinary inquiry began based on a charge sheet dated 15.10.2020 (marked 'P35'). The Petitioner argues that the charges in the sheet are pernicious, ill-motivated, and trivial; however, such issues need to be addressed at the disciplinary inquiry. The Establishments Code of the Government of Sri Lanka, although not applicable to University staff, in Clause 14:1 (Chapter XLVIII) requires a clear and simple statement of facts or omissions for which the officer is intended to be punished. The Court sees no ex-facie illegality or unlawfulness in issuing the charge sheet and thus finds no reason to examine these charges at this stage. The primary issue for the Court is whether the suspension of services and salary payments to the Petitioner is rational. The Petitioner contends that the suspension is ultra vires, unreasonable, and irrational as it was done without a hearing or giving reasons. Based on the circumstances of this case, the court references Chapter XXII of the University Establishment Code, particularly Section 18 which deals with Interdiction and Compulsory Leave. According to Section 18:1, an individual may be interdicted if disciplinary or criminal proceedings are impending or if a Court or Statutory Authority report implies serious misconduct. However, the Respondents failed to show that the charges were serious enough for dismissal, and no evidence was provided that the Petitioner’s presence hindered the disciplinary inquiry. The court noted that the Petitioner's suspension, dated 30.09.2020, and the unresolved disciplinary inquiry lacked rational basis and substantial delay. The rationale in Section 18:3 emphasizes completing proceedings promptly, which hadn't occurred. Similarly, Section 8:7 of Chapter VI allows for partial emolument payment if disciplinary proceedings are delayed beyond a year without serious charges. The court observed over two years had passed since the Petitioner's suspension without resolution, and the withholding of emoluments under Sections 8:2 and 8:3 usually pertains to specific severe criminal charges, which were not evidenced here. Due to the special circumstances and lack of justified delay, the court decided to quash the Respondents’ decision to suspend the Petitioner’s services and salary payments. The court refrained from addressing other reliefs sought by the Petitioner, emphasizing that the disciplinary inquiry should proceed without encumbrances or special privileges for the Petitioner during this period. The Petitioner requested a writ of Mandamus to direct several Respondents to pay back wages in case their innocence is proven at a disciplinary inquiry. The court held that the decision on back wages and other emoluments lies with the relevant Disciplinary Authority post-inquiry. The court concluded that suspending salary payment does not grant the Petitioner the right to back wages for the period before this judgment. Writs were issued as prayed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of the Petitioner's prayer. The judgment does not prevent Authorities from continuing and concluding the disciplinary inquiry promptly or taking appropriate actions, including service suspension if new evidence shows the Petitioner's continuation is detrimental to the inquiry. The application is partly allowed. Judge of the Court of Appeal Dhammika Ganepola J. concurred by another Judge of the Court of Appeal."

The complaint was made under Article 154P(6) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka and Section 11(1) of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990. The initial dispute was heard by the Baddegama Magistrate's Court (Case No. 4091), where Dharmasiri alleged a breach of peace over a property dispute under Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979. The Magistrate ruled on October 27, 2014, in favor of Rohitha and Anandagoda, based on their possession of the disputed premises as per Section 68(1) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act. Dharmasiri sought revision in the Provincial High Court of the Southern Province (Case No. HC/Rev/83/2014). The Provincial High Court eventually ruled that the appeal be moved to the Court of Appeal (Case No. CA (PHC) 224/18). Counsel for the Respondent-Respondent-Appellants was Vidura Ranawaka with Menaka Warnapura, while Upul Kumarapperuma with Radha Kuruwitabandara represented the Complainant-Petitioner-Respondent. Written submissions were finalized on April 21, 2022, and the judgment was delivered on February 7, 2023, by Justice Prasantha De Silva. The Order was made by the learned High Court Judge on 28.12.2018 revising the said Order of the learned Magistrate dated 27.10.2014 on the basis that it was contrary to the provisions of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 and the learned Magistrate had not made a determination under Section 68(3) of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act, determining whether the Respondent was dispossessed during the presiding two months period of the institution of the Magistrate's Court case. The Respondent urged that the learned High Court Judge held the Order dated 27.10.2014 of the learned Magistrate was erroneous and revised the same on the basis that the learned Magistrate had not considered Section 68(3) but granted possession to the 1st and 2nd Respondent-Respondent-Appellants without considering the dispossession of the Respondent. The learned Magistrate held that the Appellants were in possession of the disputed premises in terms of Section 68(1) of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act. However, the Respondent contended that facts and circumstances of the instant case are based on forcible dispossession under Section 68(3) of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act. It is settled law that Section 68(3) becomes applicable only if the Judge of the Primary Court can come to a definite finding that some other party had been forcibly dispossessed within a period of 2 months immediately before the date on which the information was filed under Section 66 of the Act [Ramalingam Vs. Thangarajah]. Dayananda, looking after the premises, was attacked by the 1st Appellant, resulting in Dayananda being admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at Karapitiya Hospital with severe injuries. This attack led to the non-occupancy of the premises. The Respondent padlocked the premises to keep the 1st and 2nd Appellants away. The 1st Appellant did not confirm or deny Dayananda's occupancy of the premises and maintained silence on this matter. The Appellants did not possess the keys to the premises during these events, and the 1st Appellant stated that his mother refused to give him the keys. Notably, the 1st Appellant made a statement on 16.05.2013 at the Baddegama Police Station detailing his mother's actions of securing the house and taking the keys, which left him unable to access the premises where his belongings were kept. The 1st Appellant admitted in his affidavit that he had not been in possession of the premises for more than five months. The Appellants admitted in their affidavit dated 11.12.2013 that they broke open the padlocks and entered the premises on 16.09.2013, showing that the Respondent's aunt, the mother of the 1st Appellant, had control over the disputed premises through constructive possession. The Respondent was dispossessed on 16.09.2013, and learned of this on 17.09.2013. A complaint was made by the Respondent to Baddegama Police Station on 07.09.2013, followed by filing information on 30.10.2013 under Section 66(1) of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act through an affidavit. The High Court Judge held that Respondent was dispossessed within two months from filing the information, but the Magistrate did not consider the dispossession under Section 68(3) and erroneously decided the dispute under Section 68(1), favoring the Appellants. The Appellants argued that the Respondent was never in possession of the premises, and the Respondent did not state in his affidavit that he was in possession, failing to prove possession of the disputed premises. The court noted the complaint made by the 2nd Appellant on 17.09.2013. The 2nd Appellant stated that they had been living together with the complainant's brothers but had to leave due to a family dispute, and during that time, several items went missing. The complaint indicates that the Appellants left the premises because of broken friendly relations with the 1st Appellant's mother. After they left, the mother was in possession, establishing her control over the disputed premises. According to the statement dated 17.09.2013 by Complainant-Petitioner-Respondent Kapila Dharmasiri, his aunt transferred the two-storied building to him and his wife as a gift, documented with Deed No. 173. Dharmasiri frequently visited the property. He received a phone call from Wilson Disanayake, who noticed something about the upper floors. Dharmasiri mentioned he went to the property and encountered a person named Dinesh. The Respondent did not claim in his affidavit that he possessed the disputed premises, leading the Appellants to argue that the Respondent never had possession. The Respondent failed to prove possession of the disputed premises, leading the Appellants to argue there was no dispossession by them on 17.09.2013. The Respondent, Kapila Dharmasiri, complained to the Baddegama Police on 10.10.2013 about the property. The Deed of Gift No. 1733 dated 11.03.2013, marked as Exhibit P1, indicated that Thelikda Gamage Lalitha Charlet had gifted the disputed property to the Respondent and his wife on 11.03.2013. The Respondent also leased out shop premises as per lease agreements P6, P7, and P8. It was clear that Lalitha Charlotte and the Respondent had control over the entire premises, including the disputed property. However, the Magistrate ruled in favor of the Appellants, determining they had possession as per Section 68(1) of the Act. The court noted that the mother of the 1st Appellant and the Respondent had constructive possession of the property, supported by evidence that T.G. Dayananda was appointed caretaker. While the Appellant’s mother or the Respondent did not have physical possession on the day the action was filed, they had constructive possession. This stance aligns with the judgment in Iqbal vs. Majedudeen [1999] 3 SLR 213, which recognized two types of possession: actual and constructive. In the judgment, it examines the concept of constructive possession, which is defined in Black’s Law Dictionary as control or dominion over property without actual possession. It references the case of Iqbal Vs. Majedudeen, determining that the Respondent had constructive possession of the disputed premises at the time of the action. The entry of the Appellants into the premises amounted to dispossession. The court holds that both parties could argue constructive possession, leading to a balanced evidence scenario. Per Section 66 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, when possession is balanced, the presumption of possession favors the titleholder. Sharvananda J. in Ramalingam Vs. Thangarajah asserts that possession presumption flows from title. The High Court Judge correctly favored the 1st Respondent, the titleholder, as the evidence was balanced. The judgment references Ponnamperuma Arachchige Sunil Kumara Vs. Nanayakkarawasam Patudoowe Vidanalage Gnanawathie, asserting that title evidence is crucial in balanced possession cases. Despite the balanced evidence, the Respondent and his wife owned the premises, securing possession in their favor. Section 66's application is appropriate when possession evidence is balanced, and title supports the possession presumption. The High Court Judge correctly decided under Section 68(3), affirming the Respondent's possession but failed to provide reasoning, highlighting judicial responsibility to"

Haris, and others, along with the Erukkalampiddy Fishermen Co-Operative Society, filed an application under Article 140 of the Constitution seeking Writs of Certiorari, Mandamus, and Prohibition against multiple respondents including various Director Generals of governmental departments and ministers. They challenged the actions and decisions regarding a shrimp farm project in Erukkalampiddy, Mannar by Taprobane Frozen Food (Pvt) Ltd., which had applied for permits under the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resources Management Act, No. 57 of 1981. Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) was conducted, followed by a joint field inspection and subsequent approvals from various authorities. The Petitioners claimed the project violated the Sri Lanka Coastal Zone and Coastal Resource Management Plan - 2018 and that necessary permits, especially under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, No. 02 of 1937 for shrimp importation, were not obtained. They sought several writs, including to quash permit P22 issued under Section 14 due to violations of natural justice and for lack of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). They also alleged the shrimp farm cleared mangroves and operated illegally. The learned President’s Counsel for the 12th Respondent argued that the necessary permits were obtained under the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act per Gazette No. 1036/13 dated 16.06.1998, negating the need for Fauna and Flora Ordinance permits. Section 16 of the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resources Management Act allows the Director General to decide on the necessity of an IEE or EIA. The court referred to precedents like Environmental Foundation Limited vs. Central Environmental Authority (2006) and Nirmal Anrudha Madanayaka vs. Director General, Dept. of Coast Conservation, confirming the Director General's proper exercise of discretion. The court found the permit P22 conformed with the Coastal Resource Management Plan 2018 and was not issued illegally. However, since the shrimp farm's construction was complete and operations ongoing, the permit marked P22 had already expired, rendering the Petitioners' request for a Writ of Certiorari to quash it futile. Citing precedence, the court noted that writs would not issue if futile. Consequently, the court dismissed the Petitioners' application, awarding no costs."

WRIT 88-2019 In the Court of Appeal of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka: Seylan Bank PLC initiated a writ application under Article 140 of the Constitution seeking Certiorari and Prohibition against labor authorities and a former employee over a gratuity payment dispute. The Petitioner Bank had issued an internal memorandum titled ""Gratuity Payment"" on 5th October 2004, promising enhanced gratuity during profitable periods, which was rescinded by a subsequent memorandum due to financial crisis. The 4th Respondent and others complained to the Department of Labour of the cancellation. After an inquiry, the 3rd Respondent ordered the Bank to pay the enhanced gratuity, which the Bank challenged. Key issues included whether the enhanced gratuity as per the ""P3"" document constituted a binding obligation and whether the Assistant Labour Commissioner's ""P8"" decision was enforceable under sections of the Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983. The Bank argued that the P3 letter did not reflect a Board decision and was thus ex-gratia. Despite financial distress necessitating the reversion of enhanced payments, the Assistant Commissioner based the decision on the P3 document. The Deputy Solicitor General stated that enhanced gratuity payments should follow Section 10 of the Gratuity Act, which the Bank rejected citing financial constraints post-2008. The court examined whether due process and principles of natural justice were followed, concluding that the Assistant Commissioner acted arbitrarily by not considering the financial crisis or providing reasons for dismissing the Petitioner's arguments. Citing Geeganage v Director General, Customs and Podimhathmaya v The Land Reform Commission, the court emphasized non-arbitrary statutory enforcement. The Court of Appeal granted the reliefs requested, setting aside the Assistant Labour Commissioner's decision, affirming the need for financial crises to be considered in such decisions. Judge of the Court of Appeal M Sammath K. B Wijeratne concurred. No costs were ordered."

Chaminda, Sub-Inspector of Police, sought Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus under Article 140 of the Constitution against the National Police Commission (NPC) and the Public Service Commission (PSC), among others. The Petitioner, initially from the Reserve Police Service, was absorbed into the Regular Service and promoted to Inspector of Police. On 19.01.2015, he was charged with three offenses: (I) Disreputable conduct under Section 1 of the Police Disciplinary Code for aiding and abetting a gang in the theft or misappropriation of 5 heads of cattle, (II) Pre-verification under Section 5(B) of the Public Disciplinary Code for making a false statement, (III) Aiding and Abetting in the commission of an act of indiscipline under Section 16 of the Police Disciplinary Code. The Petitioner pleaded not guilty but was found guilty after a formal disciplinary inquiry and subsequently demoted from Inspector to Sub-Inspector. The case mentions relevant entities such as the National Police Commission, Public Service Commission, and the Attorney General's Department, with references to the Police Disciplinary Code and Article 140 of the Constitution. Aggrieved by the decision, the Petitioner appealed to the National Police Commission, where the appeal was rejected and punishments were ordered effective (R1). The Petitioner subsequently appealed to the Administrative Appeal Tribunal (AAT) on 01.03.2019 (P1). The Commission submitted observations (P2), and the Petitioner submitted written submissions (P3). On 25.08.2020, the AAT dismissed the appeal (P4). The Petitioner then filed this Writ Application seeking, inter alia, a Writ of Certiorari to quash the AAT's decision (P4). The Petitioner confined the application to this relief, arguing that evidence from PW1 and PW2 at the Formal Disciplinary Inquiry was not corroborated and no direct or circumstantial evidence proved the Petitioner's involvement. The Petitioner claimed bias from PW1 and PW2 due to a past arrest of PW2’s brother. The Petitioner asserted that the AAT's decision contained an error of law. The Respondents contended that the Formal Disciplinary Inquiry and AAT had duly considered all evidence. The learned SSC argued the Petitioner failed to show any defect in the evaluation of evidence or provide a basis for claiming a legal error. Citing Gunasekera Vs. De Mel, the Court emphasized that findings unsupported by evidence or irrational inferences constituted legal errors. However, it found the AAT had adequately evaluated the evidence, affirming the charges on the balance of probability, and thus saw no grounds for judicial review of the AAT's decision. If reasons are given and these disclose that an erroneous legal approach has been followed, the superior Court can set the decision aside by certiorari for error of law on the face of the record. If the reasons stated disclose a clearly erroneous legal approach, the decision will be quashed. An error of law may be held to be apparent if the decisions reached by the tribunal are such as no reasonable body of persons properly instructed in the law could have made. This Court is satisfied that the AAT's reasons for its decision are neither inconsistent, unintelligible, substantially inadequate, nor legally flawed. The AAT has neither followed an erroneous legal approach nor concluded without any supporting evidence. In Chas Hayley and Co. Ltd. v. Commercial and Industrial Workers, Senanayake, J. elaborated on error of law on the face of the record, stating it as a ground for certiorari. A finding of fact may be impugned on the grounds of error of law if it erroneously refuses to admit admissible evidence, admits inadmissible evidence which influences the finding, or acts with manifest unreasonableness. In reviewing the AAT’s decision (P4), this Court finds no error of law as all evidence was considered without clear unreasonableness. The Petitioner seeks to quash the AAT's Order but not the Commission's (R1) and the Inquiring Officer's (R2) decisions, which would remain intact even if the AAT's decision is quashed. In Samastha Lanka Nidahas Grama Niladhari Sangamaya v. Dissanayake, it was held no court will issue a writ where doing so would be vexatious or futile. Similarly, in Siddeek v. Jacolyn Seneviratne, Soza J. observed that the writ of certiorari will not issue where the end result will be futility, frustration, injustice and illegality. No relief has been sought against that decision although the petitioners were aware of it 4 [1984] 1 Sri LR 83. 5 (2004) SLR 180.11 having received P2 and P5. In the circumstances, it would be futile to grant the relief prayed for since it would still leave intact the decisions made by the 4th respondent. Therefore, even if the decision of the AAT is quashed the decisions of the Commission and the Inquiring Officer will remain intact and the Application would be futile. For the reasons above-mentioned this Court is not inclined to issue a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the AAT marked as P4 as prayed for in prayer (b)(i) of the Petition. Therefore, the Court dismisses the Writ Application. No costs ordered. Application dismissed. JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL M. T. Mohammed Laffar, J. I agree. JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL"

The order 'P9' determined that the Petitioner terminated the 3rd Respondent's services without his written consent or prior written approval from the Commissioner of Labour. The Petitioner was directed to pay Rs.450,000 as compensation. The termination occurred on 16.05.2020 via a letter dated 17.04.2020 marked 'P5(c)'. The Petitioner contends that the 3rd Respondent, being in his probationary period, is not entitled to relief under TEWA. Clause 8 of the Letter of Appointment marked 'P2' stipulates a probationary period of six months, extendable by three months. The Petitioner argues that there cannot be automatic confirmation of employment during probation, and the service termination during this period should adhere to Common Law principles governing probationers, not overridden by TEWA. The case examines whether probationary employment can be terminated for reasons beyond performance and conduct. The 1st, 2nd, and 4th Respondents rely on the precedent from Lanka Canneries v. Commissioner of Labour CA/WRIT/385/2021 decided on 31.08.2022, where the Court held that employers must follow legal procedures, providing reasons under section 2(5) of TEWA when terminating or extending an employee's probationary period. The Court references Hettiarachchi vs. Vidyalankara University 76 NLR 47, Ceylon Cement Corporation vs. Fernando (1990) 1 Sri L.R. 361, State Distilleries Corporation vs. Rupasinghe (1994) 2 Sri L.R. 395, K. A. D. T. Kulawansa v. University of Moratuwa CA/WRIT/111/2022 on 17.11.2022, and Chandima Sudeshika Kumari Dissanayake v. Uva Provincial Council CA/WRIT/28/2021 on 10.10.2023. They establish that a probationary workman's services cannot be terminated without providing reasons related to conduct or performance. The employer must assess a probationer's progress using reasonable criteria. The termination letter 'P5(c)' shows the Petitioner terminated the 3rd Respondent without prior written consent or approval from the Commissioner, citing financial distress due to a global crisis. The 3rd Respondent's termination did not involve considerations of work performance, honesty, integrity, discipline, or standards. Citing Magpeck Exports Ltd v. Commissioner of Labour and Others (2000) 2 Sri L.R. 308 (CA), the court noted that the doctrine of frustration is inapplicable when only one party foresees the events that frustrated the contract. The Petitioner argued that the TEWA doesn't apply to probationary workers based on Common Law principles, citing works and cases such as Singer Industries (Pvt) Ltd v. CMU and Others SC/Appeal 78/08, Wijenaike v. Air Lanka Limited and Other 1990 1 Sri L.R. 293, The Lanka Estate Workers’ Union v. The Superintendent, Hewagama Estate S.C. (SCM) 7-9/69, and Jayasuriya v. Sri Lanka Plantation Corporation (1995 2 Sri L.R. 407). Additionally, the Petitioner relied on Brown & Co. Ltd v. Samarasekara (1996) 1 Sri L.R. 334, Hettiarachchi v. Vidyalankara University 76 N.L.R. 47, and State Distilleries Corporation v. Rupasinghe (1994) 2 Sri L.R. 395. The Petitioner's key argument is based on whether there was automatic confirmation of employment under Common Law and the circumstances under which the probation period ends. The State Counsel for the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Respondents cited Encyclopædia Britannica and cases such as Vasantha Kumara v. Skypan Asia (Pvt) Ltd. (2008) 1 S.L.R 324 observed by Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, highlighting that Labour Laws modified the Common Law position. Under the Industrial Disputes Act, Labour Tribunals can override contrary contractual provisions. Influential discussions on Common Law, incorporating works by L.J.M. Cooray and legal systems from Sri Lanka, align with the local judicial developments. In ""Kodeeswaran v. The Attorney General,"" Lord Diplock supports evolving indiginous common law over traditional Roman-Dutch or English rules. The interpretation of TEWA regarding probationers should consider Sri Lankan indigenous Common Law. The interpretation of probation under TEWA is modernized, seeing probation as crucial for assessing performance, and the Court concludes TEWA provisions apply to probationers, including the 3rd Respondent. The Petitioner's compensation argument is moot due to unlawful termination. Section 6D of TEWA allows Commissioner discretion in compensation decision. Therefore, the Petitioner's prayer for relief is denied, and the Application is dismissed by Judge Dhammika Ganepola J."

Methsiri De Silva, Chairman Southern Provincial Development Authority, Baladaksha Mawatha, Galle, et al. Petition for mandates in the nature of Writs of Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus under Article 140 of the Constitution. The Petitioner, T.R.B. Mallawarachchi, Director General of the Southern Development Authority, sought several Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus, including quashing the charge sheet dated 08-06-2020 (P27), the letter dated 08-06-2020 (P26), and the preliminary inquiry report dated 10.12.2019 (P25). Additionally, the Petitioner sought to prohibit the Respondents from conducting any further preliminary inquiry and to reinstate him. The internal audit report accused the Petitioner of serious financial misconduct and violating Provincial Financial Regulations, leading to steps taken by the Chief Secretary of the Southern Province to conduct a preliminary inquiry through the Chief Secretariat Audit Division. The inquiry report dated 24.06.2019 is produced as R13, resulting in the Petitioner’s interdiction by the Governor of the Southern Province on 04.07.2019 (P22) and subsequent charge sheet on 08.06.2020 (P27). The fundamental argument by the Petitioner’s counsel was that the Governor or the Public Service Commission lacked the authority for such actions under the SPDA Statute No. 01 of 1995, which vested disciplinary control with the Southern Provincial Development Authority. The case referenced the overarching supervisory role of the Governor as per Article 154B (11), with residuary powers under Section 27A of the Provincial Councils Act, No. 42 of 1987 (as amended). The Governor's discretionary executive authority under Article 154C was contested, particularly whether these actions were within constitutional limits. The jurisdiction concerning the interpretation of the Constitution under Article 125, reserving such interpretative power solely for the Supreme Court, raised questions about the legality of the Governor’s interdiction actions under Articles 154C and 154F. The court highlighted the Governor’s role and the legal boundaries of executive power in provincial governance. The Application was dismissed without costs."

The Petitioner owned land known as “Iriyagahapillewa” (Deed No. 9720 dated 26.09.1973 marked as P1A), within the Surveyor General’s Plan No. 144693 dated 10.04.1888 (P1B). The Road Development Authority (RDA) acquired portions of this land under the Land Acquisition Act, No. 9 of 1950 for the Southern Expressway construction, specifically Lot No. 4 (Plan No. 8623 dated 01.07.2003, marked as P2B) and Lot No. 9 (Plan No. 8920 dated 14.05.2008, marked as P3B), announced in Gazette Notifications No. 1298/6 dated 21.07.2003 (P2A) and No. 1563/38 dated 22.08.2008 (P3A). The Petitioner alleged errors in the Gazette Notifications, incorrect land names, and Claimant details, depriving him of compensation. He claimed 27.5 Perches acquired officially, but 34.5 Perches were used without official acquisition. The Divisional Secretary of Homagama admitted in a letter dated 28.02.2018 (P8) that Lot No. 4 and Lot No. 9 are portions of “Iriyagahapillewa.” The Petitioner made multiple representations, and actions were instituted in the District Court of Homagama on 29.06.2012; compensation was deposited under the Act. The Petitioner’s claim for Lot 9 compensation was dismissed on 06.12.2019 (P6) due to differing land names in the Gazette (P3B) and the title deed (P1A). The Petitioner appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court of Homagama (P7), where the 2nd Respondent admitted the Petitioner was entitled to compensation for Lot 9 (C7). The Petitioner sought Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus to quash incorrect Gazette notifications, correct them, and grant market-rate compensation. Compensation was decided by the LARC, evidenced by documents R8, R9, C1, R20, R22, and C3, but the Petitioner disagreed, stating it was below market value. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner argued the incorrect naming of the land in Gazette Notifications P2A and P3A resulted in the Petitioner not receiving due compensation. The learned DSG argued that an inquiry under Section 9 of the Act identified the Petitioner as the owner of Lots 4 and 9. The Petitioner applied to quash these notifications in 2020, over 12 years later, without explaining this delay. Referring to Biso Menika vs. Cyril de Alwis and Others, it was argued that writs must be sought promptly. Issadeen v. The Commissioner of National Housing supports the requirement for proper justification for delays. Consequently, the Court refused to issue a Writ of Certiorari due to unexplained delay. The Petitioner also contended that the compensation was lower than market rate. The learned DSG argued that compensation was assessed per Section 46 of the Act, and the market value should follow Section 45 guidelines. Higher compensation for Lot 5 was due to different publication dates. C.E.A Perera v. The Assistant Government Agent, Kaluthara, states that market value is based on willing seller principles. In D. S. Fernando vs Minister of Higher Education and Highways, market value determination hinges on the notice date under Section 7 of the Act. Section 7 notices for Lots 4 and 9 were published on 21.07.2003 and 22.08.2008 (P2A and P3A), and for Lot 5 on 14.09.2010 (R34). The Petitioner's argument for higher compensation for Lot 5 lacked legal basis due to different publication dates. Compensation decisions for Lots 4 and 9 (R9 and R22) are unchallenged as the Petitioner bypassed the Board of Review under Section 22 of the Act. In Obeysekera vs. Albert and others and Linus Silva vs. University Council of Vidyodaya University, it was established that certiorari is not granted without exhausting other remedies. Tennakoon vs. Director-General of Customs held writ jurisdiction unwarranted if alternative remedies exist. The Petitioner's claim of inadequate compensation, disputed by the DSG, hinges on factual disagreements unsuitable for Writ jurisdiction. Writs do not substitute legal suits when factual disputes exist (Thajudeen vs. Sri Lanka Tea Board). Dr. Puvanendran and Another vs. Premasiri affirmed that Mandamus is discretionary if other remedies exist. The Common Law requires that major facts not be in dispute and the function compelled must be a public duty. Wijenayake and others Vs. Minister of Public Administration stated disputed facts cannot be decided by a Writ court. Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service and Regina v. Hull University Visitor established that courts ensure public decision-making bodies exercise powers lawfully. A settlement regarding compensation for Lot 9 applies the principle of res judicata, precluding litigation in this Writ Application. Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka Vs. Randenigala Distilleries Lanka stated res judicata protects against repetitive legal attacks. The Court dismissed the Application, ordered the Petitioner to pay Rs. 50,000/- as costs. Application dismissed."
