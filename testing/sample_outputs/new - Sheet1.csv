The Petitioner owned land known as “Iriyagahapillewa” (Deed No. 9720 dated 26.09.1973 marked as P1A), within the Surveyor General’s Plan No. 144693 dated 10.04.1888 (P1B). The Road Development Authority (RDA) acquired portions of this land under the Land Acquisition Act, No. 9 of 1950 for the Southern Expressway construction, specifically Lot No. 4 (Plan No. 8623 dated 01.07.2003, marked as P2B) and Lot No. 9 (Plan No. 8920 dated 14.05.2008, marked as P3B), announced in Gazette Notifications No. 1298/6 dated 21.07.2003 (P2A) and No. 1563/38 dated 22.08.2008 (P3A). The Petitioner alleged errors in the Gazette Notifications, incorrect land names, and Claimant details, depriving him of compensation. He claimed 27.5 Perches acquired officially, but 34.5 Perches were used without official acquisition. The Divisional Secretary of Homagama admitted in a letter dated 28.02.2018 (P8) that Lot No. 4 and Lot No. 9 are portions of “Iriyagahapillewa.” The Petitioner made multiple representations, and actions were instituted in the District Court of Homagama on 29.06.2012; compensation was deposited under the Act. The Petitioner’s claim for Lot 9 compensation was dismissed on 06.12.2019 (P6) due to differing land names in the Gazette (P3B) and the title deed (P1A). The Petitioner appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court of Homagama (P7), where the 2nd Respondent admitted the Petitioner was entitled to compensation for Lot 9 (C7). The Petitioner sought Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus to quash incorrect Gazette notifications, correct them, and grant market-rate compensation. Compensation was decided by the LARC, evidenced by documents R8, R9, C1, R20, R22, and C3, but the Petitioner disagreed, stating it was below market value. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner argued the incorrect naming of the land in Gazette Notifications P2A and P3A resulted in the Petitioner not receiving due compensation. The learned DSG argued that an inquiry under Section 9 of the Act identified the Petitioner as the owner of Lots 4 and 9. The Petitioner applied to quash these notifications in 2020, over 12 years later, without explaining this delay. Referring to Biso Menika vs. Cyril de Alwis and Others, it was argued that writs must be sought promptly. Issadeen v. The Commissioner of National Housing supports the requirement for proper justification for delays. Consequently, the Court refused to issue a Writ of Certiorari due to unexplained delay. The Petitioner also contended that the compensation was lower than market rate. The learned DSG argued that compensation was assessed per Section 46 of the Act, and the market value should follow Section 45 guidelines. Higher compensation for Lot 5 was due to different publication dates. C.E.A Perera v. The Assistant Government Agent, Kaluthara, states that market value is based on willing seller principles. In D. S. Fernando vs Minister of Higher Education and Highways, market value determination hinges on the notice date under Section 7 of the Act. Section 7 notices for Lots 4 and 9 were published on 21.07.2003 and 22.08.2008 (P2A and P3A), and for Lot 5 on 14.09.2010 (R34). The Petitioner's argument for higher compensation for Lot 5 lacked legal basis due to different publication dates. Compensation decisions for Lots 4 and 9 (R9 and R22) are unchallenged as the Petitioner bypassed the Board of Review under Section 22 of the Act. In Obeysekera vs. Albert and others and Linus Silva vs. University Council of Vidyodaya University, it was established that certiorari is not granted without exhausting other remedies. Tennakoon vs. Director-General of Customs held writ jurisdiction unwarranted if alternative remedies exist. The Petitioner's claim of inadequate compensation, disputed by the DSG, hinges on factual disagreements unsuitable for Writ jurisdiction. Writs do not substitute legal suits when factual disputes exist (Thajudeen vs. Sri Lanka Tea Board). Dr. Puvanendran and Another vs. Premasiri affirmed that Mandamus is discretionary if other remedies exist. The Common Law requires that major facts not be in dispute and the function compelled must be a public duty. Wijenayake and others Vs. Minister of Public Administration stated disputed facts cannot be decided by a Writ court. Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service and Regina v. Hull University Visitor established that courts ensure public decision-making bodies exercise powers lawfully. A settlement regarding compensation for Lot 9 applies the principle of res judicata, precluding litigation in this Writ Application. Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka Vs. Randenigala Distilleries Lanka stated res judicata protects against repetitive legal attacks. The Court dismissed the Application, ordered the Petitioner to pay Rs. 50,000/- as costs. Application dismissed."

The Petitioners had obtained a loan and overdraft from People’s Bank, mortgaging property as security. After failing to repay, People’s Bank resolved to auction the mortgaged land. The Petitioners argued that they were owed payments for construction work under the Maga Neguma Construction Project, which had liquidated, leading to non-payment. They claimed the non-payment by Maga Neguma caused their inability to repay the loan to People’s Bank. The main argument was that the Petitioners needed to receive payments from Maga Neguma to repay People’s Bank. They emphasized their role in performing state work through contracts with Maga Neguma, arguing that the failure of the state project resulted in their financial difficulties. The facilities obtained in the form of TODs and loans from People’s Bank were argued to be dependent on the subsequent payments from Maga Neguma, which fell through due to the company's liquidation. The case was supported by Rushdhie Habeeb with Supun Dissanayake and instructed by Aravindu Manathunga Arachchi. The Petitioners obtained a loan from the 1st Respondent bank, a distinct legal entity created by statute, mortgaging their property as security. They failed to honor the loan facility and do not contest the 1st Respondent's statutory rights but allege that the amount and interest charged are unreasonable and ultra vires. The relationship was found to be purely contractual, and the Petitioners did not challenge this relationship legally. Documents (P7, P8, and P9) showed conditional loan rescheduling proposals, but the Petitioners did not comply with these conditions. The bank's resolution for parate execution remained, and the Petitioners had to prove compliance with rescheduling terms, which they failed to do. They sought a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision to auction their land but did not challenge the decision or procedure adopted. The Petitioners did not demonstrate how the decision was unreasonable, ultra vires, or bad in law and failed to pursue civil litigation for alleged contract breaches. They sought more time to repay the loan but did not explain why they did not seek alternative civil remedies before invoking writ jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal in Tennakoon Vs. Director-General of Customs (2004) 1 SLR 53 emphasized the need for petitioners to exhaust alternative remedies provided by law before invoking writ jurisdiction. As referenced in J. A. L. Cooray’s ‘Constitutional and Administrative Law of Sri Lanka’, writs are not granted where there is an equally convenient alternative remedy available. Officer in Charge, Police Station Kirindiwela CA (Writ) Application No. 338/2011, decided on 22.10.2018, held; ""The question that arises for consideration in this application is what should a Court exercising Writ jurisdiction do, when confronted with an argument that an alternative remedy is available to the Petitioner and that such alternative remedy should be resorted to? This Court is of the view that a rigid principle cannot be laid down and that the appropriate decision would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. That said, where the statute provides a specific alternative remedy, a person dissatisfied with a decision of a statutory body should pursue that statutory remedy instead of invoking a discretionary remedy of this Court. That remedy should be equally effective and should be able to prevent any injustice that a Petitioner is seeking to avert. Furthermore, if the Writ jurisdiction is invoked where an equally effective remedy is available, an explanation should be offered as to why that equally effective remedy has not been resorted to.” This Court has constantly held that where there is an alternative remedy available, the writ Court will be reluctant to exercise its discretionary power. This Court has considered the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners and also has considered the documents tendered to the Court. However, after careful consideration of all the material before this Court, for the reasons stated above, this Court is not inclined to issue notice on the Respondents hence this application stands dismissed without cost."

Methsiri De Silva, Chairman Southern Provincial Development Authority, Baladaksha Mawatha, Galle, et al. Petition for mandates in the nature of Writs of Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus under Article 140 of the Constitution. The Petitioner, T.R.B. Mallawarachchi, Director General of the Southern Development Authority, sought several Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus, including quashing the charge sheet dated 08-06-2020 (P27), the letter dated 08-06-2020 (P26), and the preliminary inquiry report dated 10.12.2019 (P25). Additionally, the Petitioner sought to prohibit the Respondents from conducting any further preliminary inquiry and to reinstate him. The internal audit report accused the Petitioner of serious financial misconduct and violating Provincial Financial Regulations, leading to steps taken by the Chief Secretary of the Southern Province to conduct a preliminary inquiry through the Chief Secretariat Audit Division. The inquiry report dated 24.06.2019 is produced as R13, resulting in the Petitioner’s interdiction by the Governor of the Southern Province on 04.07.2019 (P22) and subsequent charge sheet on 08.06.2020 (P27). The fundamental argument by the Petitioner’s counsel was that the Governor or the Public Service Commission lacked the authority for such actions under the SPDA Statute No. 01 of 1995, which vested disciplinary control with the Southern Provincial Development Authority. The case referenced the overarching supervisory role of the Governor as per Article 154B (11), with residuary powers under Section 27A of the Provincial Councils Act, No. 42 of 1987 (as amended). The Governor's discretionary executive authority under Article 154C was contested, particularly whether these actions were within constitutional limits. The jurisdiction concerning the interpretation of the Constitution under Article 125, reserving such interpretative power solely for the Supreme Court, raised questions about the legality of the Governor’s interdiction actions under Articles 154C and 154F. The court highlighted the Governor’s role and the legal boundaries of executive power in provincial governance. The Application was dismissed without costs."

The order 'P9' determined that the Petitioner terminated the 3rd Respondent's services without his written consent or prior written approval from the Commissioner of Labour. The Petitioner was directed to pay Rs.450,000 as compensation. The termination occurred on 16.05.2020 via a letter dated 17.04.2020 marked 'P5(c)'. The Petitioner contends that the 3rd Respondent, being in his probationary period, is not entitled to relief under TEWA. Clause 8 of the Letter of Appointment marked 'P2' stipulates a probationary period of six months, extendable by three months. The Petitioner argues that there cannot be automatic confirmation of employment during probation, and the service termination during this period should adhere to Common Law principles governing probationers, not overridden by TEWA. The case examines whether probationary employment can be terminated for reasons beyond performance and conduct. The 1st, 2nd, and 4th Respondents rely on the precedent from Lanka Canneries v. Commissioner of Labour CA/WRIT/385/2021 decided on 31.08.2022, where the Court held that employers must follow legal procedures, providing reasons under section 2(5) of TEWA when terminating or extending an employee's probationary period. The Court references Hettiarachchi vs. Vidyalankara University 76 NLR 47, Ceylon Cement Corporation vs. Fernando (1990) 1 Sri L.R. 361, State Distilleries Corporation vs. Rupasinghe (1994) 2 Sri L.R. 395, K. A. D. T. Kulawansa v. University of Moratuwa CA/WRIT/111/2022 on 17.11.2022, and Chandima Sudeshika Kumari Dissanayake v. Uva Provincial Council CA/WRIT/28/2021 on 10.10.2023. They establish that a probationary workman's services cannot be terminated without providing reasons related to conduct or performance. The employer must assess a probationer's progress using reasonable criteria. The termination letter 'P5(c)' shows the Petitioner terminated the 3rd Respondent without prior written consent or approval from the Commissioner, citing financial distress due to a global crisis. The 3rd Respondent's termination did not involve considerations of work performance, honesty, integrity, discipline, or standards. Citing Magpeck Exports Ltd v. Commissioner of Labour and Others (2000) 2 Sri L.R. 308 (CA), the court noted that the doctrine of frustration is inapplicable when only one party foresees the events that frustrated the contract. The Petitioner argued that the TEWA doesn't apply to probationary workers based on Common Law principles, citing works and cases such as Singer Industries (Pvt) Ltd v. CMU and Others SC/Appeal 78/08, Wijenaike v. Air Lanka Limited and Other 1990 1 Sri L.R. 293, The Lanka Estate Workers’ Union v. The Superintendent, Hewagama Estate S.C. (SCM) 7-9/69, and Jayasuriya v. Sri Lanka Plantation Corporation (1995 2 Sri L.R. 407). Additionally, the Petitioner relied on Brown & Co. Ltd v. Samarasekara (1996) 1 Sri L.R. 334, Hettiarachchi v. Vidyalankara University 76 N.L.R. 47, and State Distilleries Corporation v. Rupasinghe (1994) 2 Sri L.R. 395. The Petitioner's key argument is based on whether there was automatic confirmation of employment under Common Law and the circumstances under which the probation period ends. The State Counsel for the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Respondents cited Encyclopædia Britannica and cases such as Vasantha Kumara v. Skypan Asia (Pvt) Ltd. (2008) 1 S.L.R 324 observed by Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, highlighting that Labour Laws modified the Common Law position. Under the Industrial Disputes Act, Labour Tribunals can override contrary contractual provisions. Influential discussions on Common Law, incorporating works by L.J.M. Cooray and legal systems from Sri Lanka, align with the local judicial developments. In ""Kodeeswaran v. The Attorney General,"" Lord Diplock supports evolving indiginous common law over traditional Roman-Dutch or English rules. The interpretation of TEWA regarding probationers should consider Sri Lankan indigenous Common Law. The interpretation of probation under TEWA is modernized, seeing probation as crucial for assessing performance, and the Court concludes TEWA provisions apply to probationers, including the 3rd Respondent. The Petitioner's compensation argument is moot due to unlawful termination. Section 6D of TEWA allows Commissioner discretion in compensation decision. Therefore, the Petitioner's prayer for relief is denied, and the Application is dismissed by Judge Dhammika Ganepola J."

Chaminda, Sub-Inspector of Police, sought Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus under Article 140 of the Constitution against the National Police Commission (NPC) and the Public Service Commission (PSC), among others. The Petitioner, initially from the Reserve Police Service, was absorbed into the Regular Service and promoted to Inspector of Police. On 19.01.2015, he was charged with three offenses: (I) Disreputable conduct under Section 1 of the Police Disciplinary Code for aiding and abetting a gang in the theft or misappropriation of 5 heads of cattle, (II) Pre-verification under Section 5(B) of the Public Disciplinary Code for making a false statement, (III) Aiding and Abetting in the commission of an act of indiscipline under Section 16 of the Police Disciplinary Code. The Petitioner pleaded not guilty but was found guilty after a formal disciplinary inquiry and subsequently demoted from Inspector to Sub-Inspector. The case mentions relevant entities such as the National Police Commission, Public Service Commission, and the Attorney General's Department, with references to the Police Disciplinary Code and Article 140 of the Constitution. Aggrieved by the decision, the Petitioner appealed to the National Police Commission, where the appeal was rejected and punishments were ordered effective (R1). The Petitioner subsequently appealed to the Administrative Appeal Tribunal (AAT) on 01.03.2019 (P1). The Commission submitted observations (P2), and the Petitioner submitted written submissions (P3). On 25.08.2020, the AAT dismissed the appeal (P4). The Petitioner then filed this Writ Application seeking, inter alia, a Writ of Certiorari to quash the AAT's decision (P4). The Petitioner confined the application to this relief, arguing that evidence from PW1 and PW2 at the Formal Disciplinary Inquiry was not corroborated and no direct or circumstantial evidence proved the Petitioner's involvement. The Petitioner claimed bias from PW1 and PW2 due to a past arrest of PW2’s brother. The Petitioner asserted that the AAT's decision contained an error of law. The Respondents contended that the Formal Disciplinary Inquiry and AAT had duly considered all evidence. The learned SSC argued the Petitioner failed to show any defect in the evaluation of evidence or provide a basis for claiming a legal error. Citing Gunasekera Vs. De Mel, the Court emphasized that findings unsupported by evidence or irrational inferences constituted legal errors. However, it found the AAT had adequately evaluated the evidence, affirming the charges on the balance of probability, and thus saw no grounds for judicial review of the AAT's decision. If reasons are given and these disclose that an erroneous legal approach has been followed, the superior Court can set the decision aside by certiorari for error of law on the face of the record. If the reasons stated disclose a clearly erroneous legal approach, the decision will be quashed. An error of law may be held to be apparent if the decisions reached by the tribunal are such as no reasonable body of persons properly instructed in the law could have made. This Court is satisfied that the AAT's reasons for its decision are neither inconsistent, unintelligible, substantially inadequate, nor legally flawed. The AAT has neither followed an erroneous legal approach nor concluded without any supporting evidence. In Chas Hayley and Co. Ltd. v. Commercial and Industrial Workers, Senanayake, J. elaborated on error of law on the face of the record, stating it as a ground for certiorari. A finding of fact may be impugned on the grounds of error of law if it erroneously refuses to admit admissible evidence, admits inadmissible evidence which influences the finding, or acts with manifest unreasonableness. In reviewing the AAT’s decision (P4), this Court finds no error of law as all evidence was considered without clear unreasonableness. The Petitioner seeks to quash the AAT's Order but not the Commission's (R1) and the Inquiring Officer's (R2) decisions, which would remain intact even if the AAT's decision is quashed. In Samastha Lanka Nidahas Grama Niladhari Sangamaya v. Dissanayake, it was held no court will issue a writ where doing so would be vexatious or futile. Similarly, in Siddeek v. Jacolyn Seneviratne, Soza J. observed that the writ of certiorari will not issue where the end result will be futility, frustration, injustice and illegality. No relief has been sought against that decision although the petitioners were aware of it 4 [1984] 1 Sri LR 83. 5 (2004) SLR 180.11 having received P2 and P5. In the circumstances, it would be futile to grant the relief prayed for since it would still leave intact the decisions made by the 4th respondent. Therefore, even if the decision of the AAT is quashed the decisions of the Commission and the Inquiring Officer will remain intact and the Application would be futile. For the reasons above-mentioned this Court is not inclined to issue a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the AAT marked as P4 as prayed for in prayer (b)(i) of the Petition. Therefore, the Court dismisses the Writ Application. No costs ordered. Application dismissed. JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL M. T. Mohammed Laffar, J. I agree. JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL"

WRIT 88-2019 In the Court of Appeal of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka: Seylan Bank PLC initiated a writ application under Article 140 of the Constitution seeking Certiorari and Prohibition against labor authorities and a former employee over a gratuity payment dispute. The Petitioner Bank had issued an internal memorandum titled ""Gratuity Payment"" on 5th October 2004, promising enhanced gratuity during profitable periods, which was rescinded by a subsequent memorandum due to financial crisis. The 4th Respondent and others complained to the Department of Labour of the cancellation. After an inquiry, the 3rd Respondent ordered the Bank to pay the enhanced gratuity, which the Bank challenged. Key issues included whether the enhanced gratuity as per the ""P3"" document constituted a binding obligation and whether the Assistant Labour Commissioner's ""P8"" decision was enforceable under sections of the Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983. The Bank argued that the P3 letter did not reflect a Board decision and was thus ex-gratia. Despite financial distress necessitating the reversion of enhanced payments, the Assistant Commissioner based the decision on the P3 document. The Deputy Solicitor General stated that enhanced gratuity payments should follow Section 10 of the Gratuity Act, which the Bank rejected citing financial constraints post-2008. The court examined whether due process and principles of natural justice were followed, concluding that the Assistant Commissioner acted arbitrarily by not considering the financial crisis or providing reasons for dismissing the Petitioner's arguments. Citing Geeganage v Director General, Customs and Podimhathmaya v The Land Reform Commission, the court emphasized non-arbitrary statutory enforcement. The Court of Appeal granted the reliefs requested, setting aside the Assistant Labour Commissioner's decision, affirming the need for financial crises to be considered in such decisions. Judge of the Court of Appeal M Sammath K. B Wijeratne concurred. No costs were ordered."

The respondents include B.K. Prabath Chandrakeerthi, D.M.D.M.K Dissanayaka, I.K.G. Ipitawela, and the Magistrate of Kandy's Court No.2. The petitioner requested formal notices and interim relief related to payments of gratuity for the 3rd respondent, who was charged and found guilty of fraud and misappropriation of funds by the petitioner bank. The 3rd respondent, employed as a Credit Officer (Grade II) since 1999 and promoted to Chief Manager of the Matale Branch in 2005, was later transferred to the Credit Division at the Head Office in 2016. His service was extended three times upon reaching the age of 55 but ultimately terminated on 21.11.2020. While serving as Chief Manager, he facilitated Rs. 71,090,000 worth of loans to individuals from three private, non-existent companies. An internal audit revealed forged documents and implicated fifteen officers, including the 3rd respondent. Charge Sheets dated 20.11.2017 and 14.08.2018 included thirteen and twelve charges, respectively, against the 3rd respondent. The 1st Disciplinary Inquiry against the 3rd Respondent commenced on 29.08.2018 and concluded on 05.12.2019. The 2nd Disciplinary Inquiry commenced on 27.05.2019 and is ongoing. The 3rd Respondent's application for an extension of service was declined by the Board of Directors of the Petitioner Bank due to pending disciplinary inquiries. The service of the 3rd Respondent terminated on 21.11.2020, as recorded in minutes dated 21.08.2020 and 20.11.2020. The 3rd Respondent was notified by letter dated 23.11.2020. The Board resolved to deposit and freeze the gratuity payment until the final decision of the Disciplinary Authority. Dissatisfied, the 3rd Respondent filed a complaint at the District Labour Office on 31.12.2020. The Final Inquiry Report of the first inquiry received on 29.01.2021 found the 3rd Respondent guilty of six charges. Despite pending inquiries, the 2nd Respondent ordered payment of gratuity to the 3rd Respondent. The Disciplinary Authority's order dated 19.10.2022 found the 3rd Respondent guilty of all 13 charges, resulting in termination of service and determining a financial loss of Rs. 6,757,818. The gratuity amounting to Rs. 2,677,434.80 was set off against this loss, with the remaining Rs. 4,080,383.20 payable in three monthly installments. The Petitioner filed an appeal, citing the exercise of rights under Section 13 of the Payment of Gratuity Act to forfeit the gratuity payment. The 1st Respondent, by Order dated 28.04.2023 marked as ""P32"", dismissed the appeal of the Petitioner Bank, stating that the forfeiture of gratuity under Section 13 of Act No. 12 of 1983 does not apply. The Petitioner argues that the order dated 28.04.2023 marked as ""P32"" was made with jurisdiction that the 1st Respondent does not possess, contrary to Section 31B(1)(c) of the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 (as amended), making the order ultra vires. The Petitioner asserts that the issue should have been decided by a competent Labour Tribunal under Section 31B(1)(c) of the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 (as amended), which addresses whether the forfeiture of gratuity under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1983 has been correctly made. The payment of gratuity can be forfeited under Section 13 of the Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983 if an employee's services are terminated for fraud, misappropriation, willful damage, or causing loss to the employer's property. The Petitioner Bank, formed under the State Mortgage & Investment Bank Law No. 13 of 1975, includes the Ceylon State Mortgage Bank and the Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation. The 3rd Respondent, an employee of the Petitioner Bank, is subject to the Disciplinary Rules issued by the Bank's Board of Directors under Section 74(1) of the State Mortgage & Investment Bank Law No.13 of 1975. Rule 23.3 of these rules governs the disciplinary actions and conduct of all employees. The judgment addresses the process of retirement during disciplinary proceedings, indicating that retirement is contingent on the resolution of such actions, which can affect payments or gratuity. It notes errors in the first Respondent’s order, necessitating legal examination. The Petitioner has presented sufficient grounds for issuing notice to the Respondents, and the court is satisfied to issue interim orders as requested. An interim order stays proceedings in case No. 44428/2023 in the Magistrate Court of Kandy, pending the final determination of this Application. Another interim order restrains the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Respondents, their agents, servants, and successors from enforcing the contested orders and certificates dated 03.10.2022 (“P28(i)” and “P28(ii)”) and 28.04.2023 (“P32”). Notices and Interim Orders (g) and (h) are granted."

I. Anvardeen, M. S. M. Haris, and others, along with the Erukkalampiddy Fishermen Co-Operative Society, filed an application under Article 140 of the Constitution seeking Writs of Certiorari, Mandamus, and Prohibition against multiple respondents including various Director Generals of governmental departments and ministers. They challenged the actions and decisions regarding a shrimp farm project in Erukkalampiddy, Mannar by Taprobane Frozen Food (Pvt) Ltd., which had applied for permits under the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resources Management Act, No. 57 of 1981. Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) was conducted, followed by a joint field inspection and subsequent approvals from various authorities. The Petitioners claimed the project violated the Sri Lanka Coastal Zone and Coastal Resource Management Plan - 2018 and that necessary permits, especially under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, No. 02 of 1937 for shrimp importation, were not obtained. They sought several writs, including to quash permit P22 issued under Section 14 due to violations of natural justice and for lack of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). They also alleged the shrimp farm cleared mangroves and operated illegally. The learned President’s Counsel for the 12th Respondent argued that the necessary permits were obtained under the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act per Gazette No. 1036/13 dated 16.06.1998, negating the need for Fauna and Flora Ordinance permits. Section 16 of the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resources Management Act allows the Director General to decide on the necessity of an IEE or EIA. The court referred to precedents like Environmental Foundation Limited vs. Central Environmental Authority (2006) and Nirmal Anrudha Madanayaka vs. Director General, Dept. of Coast Conservation, confirming the Director General's proper exercise of discretion. The court found the permit P22 conformed with the Coastal Resource Management Plan 2018 and was not issued illegally. However, since the shrimp farm's construction was complete and operations ongoing, the permit marked P22 had already expired, rendering the Petitioners' request for a Writ of Certiorari to quash it futile. Citing precedence, the court noted that writs would not issue if futile. Consequently, the court dismissed the Petitioners' application, awarding no costs."

Despite scoring 161 marks in the written examination (P6), the petitioner scored only 36.25% in the interview (P18), falling short of the required 40%. Her appeal to the University Services Appeal Board (USAB) (P20) was dismissed (P24), prompting her to seek judicial relief. The respondents countered that all eligible candidates, including the petitioner, were fairly interviewed using the approved marking scheme (R4) and appointments were made per the Scheme of Recruitment (SoR), with R4 used for marking. The court found no merit in the petitioner's arguments, observing discrepancies but noting no significant impact on her performance, referencing Abeysinghe and Others vs. Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau and Others (1996) 2 SLR 36. The court emphasized the need for caution in interfering with educational authorities' decisions, citing Abeysundara Mudiyanselage Sarath Weera Bandara vs. The University of Colombo and others (CA (Writ) Application No. 844/2010; CA Minutes of 8th June 2018) and Dr. C.J.A.

The Selection Committee’s appointment process was found to be compliant with UGC Circular No. 160 dated 26.02.1982 (R9) and amended by Circular No. 166 dated 06.04.1982 (R10), following the 1st Respondent's 320th meeting on 01.04.1991 (R8) and Section 71(2)(ii) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978. The petitioner was not granted relief as the court upheld that the Selection Committee was duly constituted and found no proof of procedural failure, undue bias, or violation of her legitimate expectation under Union of India vs. Hindustan Development Corporation and Nimalsiri vs. Fernando. The USAB's role was limited to conveying findings to the UGC Chairman as per Section 86(a) of the Universities Act, only investigating procedural contraventions. The petitioner's application was dismissed, with a cost of Rs. 50,000 imposed, acknowledging the USAB's proper authority and the judicial reluctance to challenge academic administrative assessments without substantial proof of illegality or unreasonableness. The decision was concurred by Judge of the Court of Appeal M. T. Mohammed Laffar, J."

The Matara Law Society (MLS) raised concerns about the relocation, particularly emphasizing the construction of a Lawyers' Office Complex near the new site. Key points proposed by the MLS include establishing a common timetable for the move, relocating all court houses together to prevent inconvenience, ensuring affordable rent for junior lawyers at the new Lawyers' Office Complex, and addressing all issues before the relocation. The MLS had previously communicated these concerns to the Justice Minister in letter 'P18' dated 15.12.2020 and also planned with the Urban Development Authority and Weligama Pradeshiya Sabha to build the new Lawyers’ Complex. The Petitioners filed this application in December 2022, highlighting the relocation issue, especially the impact on the Lawyers' Office Complex. The MLS has not received support from the Pradeshiya Sabha, and the government is not obligated to build office complexes for lawyers. Despite this, ministries typically assist in constructing such complexes. The issue is whether the obstacles faced by MLS members warrant a judicial review to grant a writ of prohibition as requested in the Petitioners' application. The ""Maha Matara Project"" initiated in 2010 included shifting the Matara Courts Complex. The MLS prepared a plan for a Lawyers’ Office Complex in Kotawila near the New Complex in 2017 but did not object to the Minister of Justice's Regulation under Section 5(3) of the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978 until December 2022. The Petitioners also complain about a foul odor from a nearby garbage disposal site, posing a hygiene risk. This site existed since the New Complex's construction. Courts often deny discretionary remedies on grounds such as futility and lack of promptitude. There is no evidence of MLS's objections during the New Complex's construction or opening. Despite acknowledging lawyers' difficulties, the court finds no grounds to issue a writ of prohibition based on particular hardships faced by MLS members. The court also questions whether the garbage site legally invalidates the Minister’s Regulation under Section 5(3). Section 5(3) states courts may be held at any place appointed by the Minister within the judicial district without restricting judges' power to hold court anywhere in their jurisdiction. Petitioners argue the Kotawila New Complex is not a ""convenient"" place for Matara courts, focusing on ""convenient place"" in Section 5(3). This issue is discussed in A. R. B. Amarasinghe J.'s book ""Judicial Conduct, Ethics and Responsibilities"". He has observed that though the Minister has the power to appoint time to time by Regulation under the relevant section of the Judicature Act a convenient place for hearing of Courts, nothing in that Section shall be construed to restrict or curtail the power possessed by every judge to hold Court at any convenient place within the judge’s territorial jurisdiction. Amarasinghe J. has referred, inter alia, to Kulantaivelpillai vs. Marikar 20 NLR 471 (at p. 475), where Bertram C.J. has held; “…He referred to the definition of ""Court"" as given in the Courts Ordinance. ""Court"" is defined in the Courts Ordinance as being ""a Judge empowered by law to act judicially alone, or a body of Judges empowered by law to act judicially as a body, when such Judge or body of Judges is acting judicially."" That definition seemed to Withers J. and Bonser C.J. to imply that a Judge is only acting judicially when he is sitting in Court. Personally, I do not so read the words in that sense. The definition does not say ""in any place in which such Judge or body of Judges is empowered to act judicially,"" but when, i.e., on any occasion on which such Judge or body of Judges is acting judicially. The question whether a Judge is acting judicially - as I understand the matter - is not to be determined by the building or place in which he sits, but by the capacity in which he purports to act.” Amarasinghe J. has illustrated several judgements where the relevant judges have taken decisions sitting at their chambers; judge’s residence and at the crime scene based on several circumstances. An examination of case law shows that the interpretation of the words ‘convenient place’ has not been extended to an instance where the State as a policy decision/administrative decision has decided to relocate the buildings of courts to another location. On a careful perusal of such judicial precedent and the effect of Section 5(3), it implies that every judge is possessed with the power to hold Court at any convenient place within his territorial jurisdiction on special circumstances on temporary basis and that power cannot be exercised to change the place of the ‘building’ which constitutes Court rooms decided by the relevant Minister by way of a Regulation. It comes to my mind in the year 1998 when the terrorists attacked the ‘Dalada Maligawa’ in Kandy. Such provisos should be considered as limitations on the manifestation of the main section but should not go against the scheme of the whole enactment. In Ismalebbe vs. Jayawardane, Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services (1990) 2 Sri. L.R. 199 (CA), S.N. Silva J. held that the proviso should be construed in relation to the entire section and where necessary in the context of even the other sections. (Also see: Jayagoda vs. Attorney General (2006) 2 Sri. L.R. 387 (CA); Salgado vs. Moses 1980 2 Sri. L.R. 6 (CA)). The Supreme Court of India in Shimbhu and another vs. State of Haryana (decided on 27.08.2013), held that a proviso should be construed in relation to the main provision. In Union of India and others vs. Dileep Kumar Singh (decided on 26.02.2015), it has been held that though a proviso does not travel beyond the provision to which it is appended, the golden rule is to read the whole section, inclusive of the proviso in such manner that they mutually throw light on each other and result in a harmonious construction. In light of my above findings, I am not inclined to agree upon the definition of the words 'convenient place' formulated even by the learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioners as I see no substantive ground in this case to consider the lawyers' 'convenience' in relocating the court premises. The main relief sought by the Petitioners is for a writ of Prohibition restraining the 1st Respondent from framing Regulations to relocate the existing Courts Complex to the New Complex at Kotawila. Thus, the instant Application of the Petitioners is presumably premature and thus, if the Minister promulgates a Regulation under Section 5(3), the Petitioners may gain a right to get such a decision reviewed on appropriate grounds, if any. I cannot gather any reason, at this stage, to restrain the relevant Minister’s power under Section 5(3) as the decision to shift the Matara Court premises has not been taken overnight but after much deliberation with the lawyers/judges over several years. The Auditor General has raised concerns over not occupying the New Complex after expending millions of Rupees of public funds."

The Petitioners, Hissalla Kankanamge Wimalsena and Padukka Vidhanalage Amarawathi, claimed that Respondents, Kathriachchi Pinnawalage Sunil Padmasiri and Kathriachchi Pinnawalage Chaminda Pushpakumara, had forcibly taken possession of a part of their land by erecting a fence, as per Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979. The Magistrate's Court case (No. 3364) involved the exchange of affidavits and documents. The Magistrate ruled on 28.08.2017 that the Petitioner was entitled to possession of the disputed land portion. The Respondents, disagreeing with this, sought the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court (case No. 07/2017). The High Court Judge on 03.12.2018 upheld the Magistrate’s decision, dismissing the Respondents’ application. Following this, the Respondents advanced their appeal to the Court of Appeal (case No. CA (PHC) 212_2018 and HCRA (Avissawella) No: 07_2017). The appeal proceedings, presided over by Justices Prasantha De Silva and K.K.A.V. Swarnadhipathi, featured arguments from counsels Thanuka Nandasiri et al. for the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant and J.M. Wijebandara et al. for the Petitioner-Respondent-Respondents. Written submissions were exchanged, with judgment delivered on 18.01.2023. Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant has preferred this appeal seeking to set aside the Order of the learned High Court Judge dated 03.12.2018 and the Order of the learned Magistrate dated 28.08.2017. It was the contention of the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant that the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge had failed to meet the fundamental objectives and requirements of Sections 66 and 68 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act No.44 of 1979. The impugned orders made by the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge in terms of Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act are provisional orders made for the purpose of preserving public peace in a dispute affecting land pending the final adjudication of the rights of parties by a competent civil court. Matters pertaining to Section 66 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act are not dealing with an investigation into the title of property in dispute or right to possession, which are functions of a civil court. Section 74(1) states: An order under this Part shall not affect or prejudice any right or interest in any land or part of a land which any person may be able to establish in a civil suit; and it shall be the duty of a Judge of a Primary Court who commences to hold an inquiry under this Part to explain the effect of these sections to the persons concerned in the dispute. The case of Punchi Nona Vs. Padumasena and Others [1994] 2 SLR 117 held that the Primary Court is not involved in an investigation into the title or the right to possession, which is the function of a civil court. Section 74(2) of the Act notes no appeal is conferred against the Order of the Primary Court. Any miscarriage of justice entitles the aggrieved party to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the respective Provincial High Court and the right to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The case Aluthhewage Harshani Chandrika and others vs Officer in Charge and others [CA PHC 65/2003 – C.A.M 21.09.2020] signifies this principle. In the case of Krishnamoorthy Sivakumar Vs. Fathima Johara Packer [CA PHC 122/2018 - C.A.M 27.09.2022], De Silva J noted the legislative intent to conclude matters in the Primary Court within three months and discouraged appeals against the Primary Court’s orders to avoid frivolous, meritless cases. The suitable avenue for adjudicating civil rights is the relevant competent civil court. When appealing a provisional order under the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, the claimant must ascertain that their claim has merit and will likely succeed, choosing the appropriate platform for remedy. High Court Judges should direct parties to competent civil courts for a final adjudication ensuring efficient justice administration. The order by the learned High Court Judge was found to painstakingly analyze the evidence, considering facts and law, ultimately dismissing the revision application by the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant. No miscarriage of justice or injustice to the Appellant was substantiated, nor were there exceptional circumstances warranting the revision jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province. The appellate court saw no valid reason to interfere with the High Court Judge's order dated 03.12.2018. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed with costs, agreed upon by JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL K.K.A.V. Swarnadhipathi, J."

P. S. Marasinghe and K. H. P. Sujeeva Fernando, filed an application for writs of Certiorari, Mandamus, and Prohibition under Article 140 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (CA/WRIT/561/2021). The respondents include Hon. Lalith U. Gamage (Governor, Central Province), J. J. Rathnasiri (Secretary, Ministry of Public Services, Provincial Councils, and Local Government), and various officials from the Central Provincial Council and the National Pay Commission, such as Gamini Rajarathna (Chief Secretary, Central Province) and Upali Wijayaweera (Chairman, National Pay Commission). The petitioners seek judicial intervention to challenge decisions and actions they deem unlawful and prejudicial to their interests. The specific accusations and issues center on administrative and employment decisions affecting the petitioners, possibly implicating procedural fairness and adherence to statutory and constitutional mandates. The outcome sought involves reversing or halting certain actions of the respondents deemed unlawful, addressing grievances tied to employment conditions and organizational decisions within public service structures in the Central Province. Relevant cases, constitutional provisions, and statutes are cited to support the petitioners' claims, highlighting the legal framework governing public service employment and administrative conduct in Sri Lanka. The petitioners in the instant application seek a writ of Certiorari to quash Gazette Notification No. 2237 dated 16.07.2021 marked 'P18', and the Scheme of Recruitment (SOR) dated 20.06.2018 marked 'P9'. Petitioners argue that the SOR contravenes Public Administration Circulars No. 06/2006 and 03/2016 and the Public Service Commission guidelines relating to the preparation of Schemes of Recruitment. The respondents, including members of the National Pay Commission, raise a preliminary objection stating that the subject matter falls within the jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Central Province as per Article 154P(4) of the Constitution, thus this court lacks jurisdiction. They also claim the petitioners are guilty of laches. Based on precedent from Senaka Sebidra Lewis vs. D. G. Ajith Priyantha and others (CA/WRIT/368/2021) where a similar objection was raised, the court finds it has jurisdiction. Petitioners mention that members of the Union of Revenue Inspectors of Local Government Service filed a similar application (No. 07/2021) in the Provincial High Court of the Central Province seeking a writ to quash the same SOR and Gazette Notification challenged in this case. The learned President’s Counsel for the petitioners informed this Court that the Provincial High Court had issued interim relief in Case No. 07/2021 (Journal entry of 24.05.2022). Section 12 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 is crucial for determining if this matter should be heard by this Court after issuing notice on the respondents. According to Section 12(a), if an appeal or application is filed in both the Court of Appeal and a High Court, and the High Court's hearing has not started, the Court of Appeal may proceed or direct the High Court to hear it. Proviso to Section 12(a) allows the Court of Appeal to transfer the matter to the High Court if deemed expedient. Paragraphs 14 and 16 of the written submissions by the petitioners state the matter should remain active in the Court of Appeal due to a potential jurisdictional issue involving the National Salaries and Cadre Commission. The respondents argue that the matter falls within the jurisdiction of the Central Provincial High Court. The Secretary to the National Pay Commission is the 6th respondent in Case No. 07/2021. Based on the petitioners' reasons and the jurisdictional position of the respondents, the Court sees no reason to hear the matter or issue formal notice at this stage and opts to transfer the case to the High Court of the Uva Province in Badulla. The decision is guided by principles from cases such as Court of Appeal Application No. 736/93, Senaka Sebidra Lewis vs. D. G. Ajith Priyantha and others, Adasuriya Mudiyanselage Rohana Bandara vs. The Governor, Wayamba Provincial Council, and others. Sunil Weerasinghe, Commissioner of Agrarian Development and others CA/Writ/23/2013 decided on 10.06.2016; Nilwala Vidulibala Company (Pvt) Ltd. vs. Kotapala Pradeshiya Sabha and others (2005) 1 Sri. L.R. 296 and Ramalingam vs. Parameswary and others (2000) 2 Sri. L.R. 340. In the circumstances, the application is transferred to the High Court of the Central Province, holden in Kandy. Thus, the Hon. High Court Judge is directed to hear and determine this application after making an appropriate order at the initial stage on the issuance of notice and the interim relief as prayed for by the petitioners. Further, the Hon. High Court Judge may consider the other preliminary objections raised by the respondents at an appropriate stage. Judge of the Court of Appeal Dhammika Ganepola, J. I agree.

The decision was made on 13.02.2023. The Petitioners claim that Indian trawlers entering Sri Lankan waters without licenses and using illegal fishing methods deprive Sri Lankan fishermen of their livelihoods, reduce national fish production, disrupt export income, and damage the ecosystem (paragraph 94). They argue that the Respondents have a duty to protect Sri Lankan fishermen, ensure the country's sovereignty, sustain fishery resources, and preserve natural resources for present and future generations. They assert that the Respondents must enhance patrols, arrests, and real-time reporting to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU) (paragraphs 95 and 96). The Petitioners seek orders in the nature of writs of Mandamus against the Respondents. The Additional Solicitor General (ASG) argued that substantial measures have been taken to address illegal fishing and claimed that the Petitioners’ Application is not maintainable due to the measures already in place and the Petitioners' failure to establish entitlement to writs of Mandamus. The ASG requested the Application be dismissed. The Petitioners’ reliefs include orders compelling the Respondents to enforce the Fisheries (Regulation of Foreign Fishing) Act No. 15 of 1979 (Amendment) Act No. 1 of 2018, protect marine life under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance No. 2 of 1937, and adhere to international conventions to prevent illegal fishing and protect marine ecology. The Petitioners argue that the prayer of the Petition seeks writs of Mandamus to compel a public body to perform statutory duties and uphold the rule of law in cases of inaction or failure. The Court must consider whether such orders can be granted under the current legal framework. The Supreme Court in Weligamawa Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society Ltd. vs. Chandradasa Daluwatta (1984) 1 Sri. L.R. 195 established that a writ of mandamus can secure the performance of a public duty of a legal interest but must not be of a private character. Misconceiving these orders does not suffice, as Mandamus is only available to compel an unperformed duty, not for erroneous exercise of power, as noted in Samaraweera vs. Balasuriya 58 NLR 118. Respondents rely on judgements like H.K.D. Amarasinghe vs. Central Environmental Authority, CA/Writ/132/2018, where broad and vague prayers are dismissed. Similarly, in Rev. Battaramulle Seelarathana vs. Ceylon Electricity Board, CA/Writ/213/2017, vague applications were dismissed due to the lack of clear directive for performing duties. The Allahabad High Court in State Election Commissioner 2006 (2) AWC 1302, 18.01.2006, addressed a vague prayer in a writ petition seeking a Mandamus to implement the U.P. Official Language Act in Local Body elections. The Court found no reason to issue such mandamus. This follows precedents such as L.T.B. Dehideniya J.'s ruling in Wanninayaka Mudiyanselage Dhanapala vs. Mr. Nimal Kotawalagedara, CA/Writ/243/2017, where the aftermath of granting writ applications was considered to avoid adverse effects on non-parties. The Court opined that prayers for mandamus must be specific to avoid unintentional Contempt of Court charges, citing Samastha Lanka Nidahas Grama Niladhari Sangamaya v. Dissanayake (2011 (2) B.L.R. 467) and P.S. Bus Company V. Secretary of Ceylon Transport Board (61 NLR 491). In Dinesh Kumar vs. Moti Lal Nehru Medical College, AIR 1990 SC 2030, the Supreme Court emphasized serious consequences for non-compliance with court orders. The Petitioners seek a writ of Mandamus to direct Respondents to perform duties under specific statutes passed by Parliament. The Court notes that granting such reliefs could open a backdoor for the Petitioners or others to file contempt charges against the Respondents for alleged inaction or omissions. Such an order might result in unusual contempt proceedings without following preliminary steps. Documents annexed, ‘X1’ and ‘X2’, show detailed statistics of arrests related to IUU (Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated) fishing: 94 vessels and 550 fishermen arrested from 2019-2022; 150 vessels auctioned, forfeited, or destroyed between 2015-2020. The court references a prior decision in Nagananda Kodithuwakku vs. Dinesh Gunawardena Minister of Education, CA/WRIT/45/2022, asserting that governance should not be directed by judges. The learned ASG submits that the relevant officials must follow the Statutes mentioned in the prayer. The court considers a passage from ""Administrative Law"" by H.W.R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth, highlighting the confusion litigants face in contract, office, and regulations cases. This confusion often leads to the failure of claims as the wrong procedures are followed, as illustrated by cases referenced by Lord Hoffman and S. Freedman and G. Morris. Consequently, the application for issuance of notice is dismissed, and objections raised by the Respondents are upheld. Judges Dhammika Ganepola and another Judge of the Court of Appeal agree with this decision."

The complaint was made under Article 154P(6) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka and Section 11(1) of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990. The initial dispute was heard by the Baddegama Magistrate's Court (Case No. 4091), where Dharmasiri alleged a breach of peace over a property dispute under Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979. The Magistrate ruled on October 27, 2014, in favor of Rohitha and Anandagoda, based on their possession of the disputed premises as per Section 68(1) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act. Dharmasiri sought revision in the Provincial High Court of the Southern Province (Case No. HC/Rev/83/2014). The Provincial High Court eventually ruled that the appeal be moved to the Court of Appeal (Case No. CA (PHC) 224/18). Counsel for the Respondent-Respondent-Appellants was Vidura Ranawaka with Menaka Warnapura, while Upul Kumarapperuma with Radha Kuruwitabandara represented the Complainant-Petitioner-Respondent. Written submissions were finalized on April 21, 2022, and the judgment was delivered on February 7, 2023, by Justice Prasantha De Silva. The Order was made by the learned High Court Judge on 28.12.2018 revising the said Order of the learned Magistrate dated 27.10.2014 on the basis that it was contrary to the provisions of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 and the learned Magistrate had not made a determination under Section 68(3) of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act, determining whether the Respondent was dispossessed during the presiding two months period of the institution of the Magistrate's Court case. The Respondent urged that the learned High Court Judge held the Order dated 27.10.2014 of the learned Magistrate was erroneous and revised the same on the basis that the learned Magistrate had not considered Section 68(3) but granted possession to the 1st and 2nd Respondent-Respondent-Appellants without considering the dispossession of the Respondent. The learned Magistrate held that the Appellants were in possession of the disputed premises in terms of Section 68(1) of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act. However, the Respondent contended that facts and circumstances of the instant case are based on forcible dispossession under Section 68(3) of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act. It is settled law that Section 68(3) becomes applicable only if the Judge of the Primary Court can come to a definite finding that some other party had been forcibly dispossessed within a period of 2 months immediately before the date on which the information was filed under Section 66 of the Act [Ramalingam Vs. Thangarajah]. Dayananda, looking after the premises, was attacked by the 1st Appellant, resulting in Dayananda being admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at Karapitiya Hospital with severe injuries. This attack led to the non-occupancy of the premises. The Respondent padlocked the premises to keep the 1st and 2nd Appellants away. The 1st Appellant did not confirm or deny Dayananda's occupancy of the premises and maintained silence on this matter. The Appellants did not possess the keys to the premises during these events, and the 1st Appellant stated that his mother refused to give him the keys. Notably, the 1st Appellant made a statement on 16.05.2013 at the Baddegama Police Station detailing his mother's actions of securing the house and taking the keys, which left him unable to access the premises where his belongings were kept. The 1st Appellant admitted in his affidavit that he had not been in possession of the premises for more than five months. The Appellants admitted in their affidavit dated 11.12.2013 that they broke open the padlocks and entered the premises on 16.09.2013, showing that the Respondent's aunt, the mother of the 1st Appellant, had control over the disputed premises through constructive possession. The Respondent was dispossessed on 16.09.2013, and learned of this on 17.09.2013. A complaint was made by the Respondent to Baddegama Police Station on 07.09.2013, followed by filing information on 30.10.2013 under Section 66(1) of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act through an affidavit. The High Court Judge held that Respondent was dispossessed within two months from filing the information, but the Magistrate did not consider the dispossession under Section 68(3) and erroneously decided the dispute under Section 68(1), favoring the Appellants. The Appellants argued that the Respondent was never in possession of the premises, and the Respondent did not state in his affidavit that he was in possession, failing to prove possession of the disputed premises. The court noted the complaint made by the 2nd Appellant on 17.09.2013. The 2nd Appellant stated that they had been living together with the complainant's brothers but had to leave due to a family dispute, and during that time, several items went missing. The complaint indicates that the Appellants left the premises because of broken friendly relations with the 1st Appellant's mother. After they left, the mother was in possession, establishing her control over the disputed premises. According to the statement dated 17.09.2013 by Complainant-Petitioner-Respondent Kapila Dharmasiri, his aunt transferred the two-storied building to him and his wife as a gift, documented with Deed No. 173. Dharmasiri frequently visited the property. He received a phone call from Wilson Disanayake, who noticed something about the upper floors. Dharmasiri mentioned he went to the property and encountered a person named Dinesh. The Respondent did not claim in his affidavit that he possessed the disputed premises, leading the Appellants to argue that the Respondent never had possession. The Respondent failed to prove possession of the disputed premises, leading the Appellants to argue there was no dispossession by them on 17.09.2013. The Respondent, Kapila Dharmasiri, complained to the Baddegama Police on 10.10.2013 about the property. The Deed of Gift No. 1733 dated 11.03.2013, marked as Exhibit P1, indicated that Thelikda Gamage Lalitha Charlet had gifted the disputed property to the Respondent and his wife on 11.03.2013. The Respondent also leased out shop premises as per lease agreements P6, P7, and P8. It was clear that Lalitha Charlotte and the Respondent had control over the entire premises, including the disputed property. However, the Magistrate ruled in favor of the Appellants, determining they had possession as per Section 68(1) of the Act. The court noted that the mother of the 1st Appellant and the Respondent had constructive possession of the property, supported by evidence that T.G. Dayananda was appointed caretaker. While the Appellant’s mother or the Respondent did not have physical possession on the day the action was filed, they had constructive possession. This stance aligns with the judgment in Iqbal vs. Majedudeen [1999] 3 SLR 213, which recognized two types of possession: actual and constructive. In the judgment, it examines the concept of constructive possession, which is defined in Black’s Law Dictionary as control or dominion over property without actual possession. It references the case of Iqbal Vs. Majedudeen, determining that the Respondent had constructive possession of the disputed premises at the time of the action. The entry of the Appellants into the premises amounted to dispossession. The court holds that both parties could argue constructive possession, leading to a balanced evidence scenario. Per Section 66 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, when possession is balanced, the presumption of possession favors the titleholder. Sharvananda J. in Ramalingam Vs. Thangarajah asserts that possession presumption flows from title. The High Court Judge correctly favored the 1st Respondent, the titleholder, as the evidence was balanced. The judgment references Ponnamperuma Arachchige Sunil Kumara Vs. Nanayakkarawasam Patudoowe Vidanalage Gnanawathie, asserting that title evidence is crucial in balanced possession cases. Despite the balanced evidence, the Respondent and his wife owned the premises, securing possession in their favor. Section 66's application is appropriate when possession evidence is balanced, and title supports the possession presumption. The High Court Judge correctly decided under Section 68(3), affirming the Respondent's possession but failed to provide reasoning, highlighting judicial responsibility to"

Ethkandure Sumanasara Thero of Sri Shailaramaya, Hokandara North, Arangala, sought writs of Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus under Article 140 of the Constitution against the Buddhist and Pali University of Sri Lanka and its officials. The respondents include the University, its Chancellor Ven. Kotugoda Dhammawasa Mahanayake Thero, Vice Chancellor Prof. Ven. Neluwe Sumanawansa Thero, and several University Council members such as Prof. Samantha Illangakoon, Ven. Moragollo Uparathana Thero, and others up to the 19th respondent, Prashantha Lal de Alwis. The petitioner's application challenges decisions/actions by the university authorities that are presumably violative of legal principles or procedural norms. The citation CA/WRIT/118/2021 is noted for reference. The Petitioner is mainly seeking writs of Certiorari to quash the decisions of the Respondents to suspend him from his post as a Sanskrit lecturer at the 1st Respondent, Buddhist and Pali University, through letters dated 30.09.2020 and 08.10.2020 (marked ‘P32a’ and ‘P33’, respectively). The payment of the Petitioner's salary was also suspended effective 02.10.2020 per letter 'P33'. Following his suspension, a formal disciplinary inquiry began based on a charge sheet dated 15.10.2020 (marked 'P35'). The Petitioner argues that the charges in the sheet are pernicious, ill-motivated, and trivial; however, such issues need to be addressed at the disciplinary inquiry. The Establishments Code of the Government of Sri Lanka, although not applicable to University staff, in Clause 14:1 (Chapter XLVIII) requires a clear and simple statement of facts or omissions for which the officer is intended to be punished. The Court sees no ex-facie illegality or unlawfulness in issuing the charge sheet and thus finds no reason to examine these charges at this stage. The primary issue for the Court is whether the suspension of services and salary payments to the Petitioner is rational. The Petitioner contends that the suspension is ultra vires, unreasonable, and irrational as it was done without a hearing or giving reasons. Based on the circumstances of this case, the court references Chapter XXII of the University Establishment Code, particularly Section 18 which deals with Interdiction and Compulsory Leave. According to Section 18:1, an individual may be interdicted if disciplinary or criminal proceedings are impending or if a Court or Statutory Authority report implies serious misconduct. However, the Respondents failed to show that the charges were serious enough for dismissal, and no evidence was provided that the Petitioner’s presence hindered the disciplinary inquiry. The court noted that the Petitioner's suspension, dated 30.09.2020, and the unresolved disciplinary inquiry lacked rational basis and substantial delay. The rationale in Section 18:3 emphasizes completing proceedings promptly, which hadn't occurred. Similarly, Section 8:7 of Chapter VI allows for partial emolument payment if disciplinary proceedings are delayed beyond a year without serious charges. The court observed over two years had passed since the Petitioner's suspension without resolution, and the withholding of emoluments under Sections 8:2 and 8:3 usually pertains to specific severe criminal charges, which were not evidenced here. Due to the special circumstances and lack of justified delay, the court decided to quash the Respondents’ decision to suspend the Petitioner’s services and salary payments. The court refrained from addressing other reliefs sought by the Petitioner, emphasizing that the disciplinary inquiry should proceed without encumbrances or special privileges for the Petitioner during this period. The Petitioner requested a writ of Mandamus to direct several Respondents to pay back wages in case their innocence is proven at a disciplinary inquiry. The court held that the decision on back wages and other emoluments lies with the relevant Disciplinary Authority post-inquiry. The court concluded that suspending salary payment does not grant the Petitioner the right to back wages for the period before this judgment. Writs were issued as prayed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of the Petitioner's prayer. The judgment does not prevent Authorities from continuing and concluding the disciplinary inquiry promptly or taking appropriate actions, including service suspension if new evidence shows the Petitioner's continuation is detrimental to the inquiry. The application is partly allowed. Judge of the Court of Appeal Dhammika Ganepola J. concurred by another Judge of the Court of Appeal."

The Petitioner also seeks a Writ of Mandamus to grant him succession. The facts reveal that Paranavithanage David, the Petitioner's and the 7th Respondent's father, obtained Permit No. LL4919 on 22-03-1938 for land located in Elpitiya, Galle District. David nominated the 7th Respondent as his successor under the Land Development Ordinance No. 19 of 1935 and registered this nomination on 12-03-1969. David later received Crown Grant GP.5110/LL4919 on 11-02-1985. The Petitioner claims David died on 19-11-1998 without nominating a successor under the Crown Grant and argues that as the oldest son, he is entitled to the succession per Section 71 of the Land Development Ordinance. The Petitioner contends the decision by the 5th Respondent, the District Secretary of Galle, to grant succession to the 7th Respondent is illegal, unreasonable, and a violation of natural justice. The State Counsel maintains that David's initial nomination of the 7th Respondent as a successor in the Permit remains valid as no fresh nomination was made in the Crown Grant. On his death and his spouse's death, the original nomination stands valid in the absence of a subsequent nomination. The Grant was transferred to the 7th Respondent as he was the nominated successor and in possession of the land. This is supported by the Supreme Court in Mallehe Vidaneralalage Don Agosinno Vs. Divisional Secretary-Thamankaduwa, where a change from a permit to a Grant does not annul a prior nomination. Similarly, in Piyasena Vs. Wijesinghe, it was held that the nomination in the Permit remains valid until cancelled. Under the Land Development Ordinance, the nomination by Paranavithanage David stands valid for the Crown Grant. The Respondents' decision to transfer the Grant to the 7th Respondent is legally valid. The Petitioner suppressed material facts about the original Permit (7R1) and the nomination of the 7th Respondent, critical to this Application. Suppression of material facts, as established in W. S. Alphonso Appuhamy v. Hettiarachchi, results in refusal of discretionary relief by the Court. The necessity of full disclosure is emphasized in R v. General Commissioner for the Purpose of the Income Tax Acts for the District of Kensington - Exparte Princess Edmond de Poigns. The Court dismissed the Application due to suppression of material facts. Additionally, the Grant transfer to the 7th Respondent occurred on 12-09-2017, and the Application was filed nearly two years later, on 03-09-2019, without a satisfactory explanation for the delay, warranting dismissal. R. de Alwis (1982 -1SLR -368), Sharvananda, J., (as he then was) observed that a Writ of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court and is not a right or issued as a matter of course. The exercise of this discretion by the Court is governed by well-accepted principles. The Court is bound to issue it at the instance of a party aggrieved by the order of an inferior tribunal except in cases where the party has disentitled himself by his own conduct, submitting to jurisdiction, laches, undue delay, or waiver. The Application for a Writ must be sought as soon as injury is caused; delay defeats equity. In Sarath Hulangamuwa Sriwardena Vs. The Principal Vishaka Vidyalaya (1986 -1SLR -275), the Court of Appeal held that Writs are extraordinary remedies granted for speedy relief under exceptional circumstances, and time is of the essence. Laches of the Petitioner is a determining factor as the Court will not make an order that cannot be carried out. It is the considered view of this Court that the nomination of a successor made by the Permit holder in his Permit is valid until revoked. If the Permit holder makes a fresh nomination in his Grant given subsequently for the same land, the original nomination becomes invalid, and the fresh nomination is valid. In the absence of a fresh nomination, the original nomination in the Permit is considered valid for the Grant. The Application made by the Petitioner is dismissed. The parties should bear their own costs. Application dismissed. JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL"

The respondents were various officials from the Department of Inland Revenue, including the Commissioner General and several Deputy Commissioners. The petitioner requested the court to order the 1st respondent to acknowledge a valid income tax appeal per section 165(6) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, submitted on 29.06.2018. The dispute arose from the petitioner's tax return for the 2015/2016 assessment year, which was rejected due to an alleged failure to declare an income of Rs. 202,638,938. An inquiry established the reasons for this non-declaration, and the assessor issued an assessment and communicated the reasons for the rejection in a letter dated 23.05.2018. A subsequent Notice of Assessment dated 30.05.2018 was served, and the petitioner filed an appeal on 29.06.2018 against this notice. The 2nd Respondent rejected the Petitioner’s appeal on 18.07.2018 (marked ‘P4’) citing: (1) the appeal was not received within 30 days from the Notice of Assessment, and (2) the Petitioner had not paid the tax and penalty as per his return. The Respondents later focused on the Petitioner’s failure to comply with Section 165(4) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, requiring payment of tax based on the Petitioner’s return before filing an appeal (marked ‘P9’). The Respondents moved to recover the default as per sections 176 and 177 of the Act. The Petitioner attended inquiries on 25.02.2019 (marked ‘2R7’) and 26.06.2019 (marked ‘2R8’) to object to the tax recovery under Section 177(3). On 20.08.2020 (marked ‘2R9’), the 1st Respondent approved tax recovery. The main issue was the Respondent's refusal to accept the appeal due to non-payment of tax by the Petitioner as required under Section 165. The appeal process per Section 165 of the Inland Revenue Act requires appeals to be filed within 30 days and taxes, along with any accrued penalties, to be paid before appealing, unless extensions are granted for reasonable causes or financial hardship. The Petitioner claimed compliance with Section 165(4) of the Act but made the payment on 17.07.2018, post-dating the appeal on 29.06.2018, rendering the appeal non-compliant and invalid. The Petitioner's payment document (P6(a)) confirmed this. The Petitioner cited discretionary power per Section 165(4) and referenced Abeyratne v Minister of Lands and Others (SC(Spl)LA No. 197/08, SC Minutes dated 01.06.2009). Discretionary powers cannot be mandated by Writ of Mandamus. The Petitioner sought a Writ of Mandamus for specific performance without quashing Respondents' determinations (documents P4 and P9), rendering their legal prayer flawed. Additionally, the Petitioner did not seek to quash document P11 issued under Section 171, establishing assessment finality when no valid appeal was lodged under Section 165(1), dismissed under Section 165(9), or agreed under Section 165(7). The court concluded that the decision complied with the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 and denied the Writ of Mandamus per Article 140, dismissing the Petitioner's application without imposing costs. Application dismissed. JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL"

The petitioner joined the Police Department as a Sub-Inspector on 13.06.1999 and was promoted to Inspector of Police on 08.02.2010. While stationed at Alawathugoda Police Station on 15.03.2006, the petitioner was tasked with investigating the death of an infant girl aged 2 ½ months. Following the post-mortem, the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) required specific parts of the body to be sent to the Government Analyst for examination and repeatedly requested the petitioner to do so until 27.03.2006. However, the petitioner failed to comply with these directives. Consequently, the JMO reported this non-compliance to the Senior Superintendent of Police, which led to a Disciplinary Inquiry against the petitioner. A charge sheet dated 26.11.2006 was issued alleging the petitioner neglected his official duties, committing offences under Section 4(A) of Appendix 'B' of the Departmental Orders marked A7. After an inquiry, the petitioner was found guilty, and a Disciplinary Order dated 18.10.2007 suspended one salary increment. The petitioner appealed to the National Police Commission (NPC) on 10.12.2007. However, with the NPC and Public Service Commission (PSC) defunct from 09.04.2009 to 12.05.2011, the appeal was referred to the Secretary of the Ministry of Defence. The Cabinet of Ministers, the appellate authority during this period, affirmed the Disciplinary Order, dismissing the appeal and communicating the decision via the Ministry of Defence letter dated 12.03.2010 marked R3. Following the re-establishment of NPC and PSC, the petitioner appealed to the PSC on 25.09.2011 (annexure marked A4), requesting reconsideration of his 10.12.2007 appeal. The NPC, by letter dated 23.08.2017 marked A5, stated the PSC had referred the appeal back to NPC but affirmed the Cabinet's decision. Challenging this, the petitioner appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) on 20.09.2017 marked X, which was dismissed on 22.07.2019, affirming the prior decision in letter A5. The AAT based dismissal on PSC Circular No. 03/2012 dated 24.12.2012 marked R4, granting appeal rights until 28.02.2013 under certain conditions. The petitioner initially appealed on 25.09.2011 as per PSC Circular No. 04/2011 dated 04.08.2011, allowing appeals until 30.09.2011. However, the Court found no evidence petitioner appealed within the period stipulated by PSC Circular R4. The PSC Circular No. 04/2011 does not apply to the petitioner because he made appeals to the NPC on 10.12.2007 and to the PSC on 25.09.2011, thus Circular No. 03/2012 is relevant. The Cabinet of Ministers dismissed his appeal, and the PSC referred his subsequent appeal to the NPC, which informed the petitioner on 23.08.2017 that it couldn't interfere with the Cabinet's decision. Consequently, no decision was taken by the NPC. The petitioner’s appeal to the AAT emanates from this lack of decision. Since neither the PSC nor the NPC made any actionable decisions, the petitioner had no basis for appealing to the AAT. Article 61A of the Constitution restricts courts or tribunals from questioning decisions made under the authority of a Commission or public officer. In Dr. M.D. W. Lokuge vs. Vidyajothi Dr. Dayasiri Fernando and others, it was held that the Constitution’s Article 61A precludes judicial review of PSC decisions under writ jurisdiction.

Dissanayake and others, it was observed that the AAT's decision on a PSC decision is subject to challenge under Article 140 as the AAT operates as an appellate tribunal constituted under Article 59(1), not as a delegate of the PSC. Relevant case references include C.A. (Writ) Application No. 160/2013 and 339/2019, Rathanayake v Administrative Appeals Tribunal & others (2013) 1 Sri LR 331, Lakmini Delapola v Justice SI Imam & others (CA Writ Application, 263/2013, CA minutes 26.07.2019), and K.N. Mankotte v Justice SI Imam & others (CA Writ 249/2015, CA Minutes 06.03.2019). The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Article 140 is limited to reviewing decisions of the AAT and does not extend to quashing decisions of the PSC or its delegates (W.A.G. Weerasinghe v P.M.K. Malalasekara & others, CA Writ Application No. 256/2018, CA Minutes 19.03.2021). In Mohamed Ismail Wahabdeen vs. His Lordship Jayantha Jayasuriya, Chairman, Judicial Service Commission, it was held that Article 61A grants broad indemnity to the PSC, precluding prerogative writs by the Court of Appeal. However, Supreme Court jurisdiction under Article 126 remains intact. Similar immunity provisions are in Article 155C regarding the NPC, following the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. The Court concluded that the petitioner cannot invoke Writ jurisdiction against the PSC's decision (C.A. Writ Application No. 468/2021). The petitioner’s counsel argued that the responsibility to send body parts to the Government Analyst was with the Officer-In-Charge of the Police Station, not him, as the cause of death by blunt force trauma was determined immediately, making further examination unnecessary. Court emphasized reviewing the legality, not the merits, of the AAT decision. Administrative Law by H.W.R. Wade & C.F. Forsyth states appeal on points of law should succeed if the tribunal's decision involved unreasonableness or legal error, leading to manifest injustice. The AAT did not act unreasonably or consider irrelevant factors, making their decision legally valid. The Court found the AAT's procedure correct and its order not illegal or irrational, and thus saw no need for interference. The petitioner’s argument on the punishment of salary increment suspension against Establishment Code section 24.2.4 was noted but upheld as valid within legal provisions. The disciplinary punishment imposed on the petitioner was the suspension of salary increment for a year as described in the Disciplinary Order marked R2. The learned Counsel for the petitioner argued that although the standard of proof in a disciplinary inquiry is on the balance of probability, the Inquiring Officer had erroneously decided that the charges were proved beyond reasonable doubt. This argument was based on the Inquiring Officer’s report dated 03.10.2007, which stated that the charges against the petitioner were proven without a doubt. The Court found that the phrase 'without doubt' did not equate to 'without a reasonable doubt' and determined that the Inquiring Officer had considered the balance of probability standard when analyzing the evidence. Therefore, the Court rejected the petitioner's argument. Consequently, the Court held that the petitioner’s Application for Writs of Certiorari was without merit and dismissed the Writ Application without ordering costs. The judgment was concurred by Judge M.T. Mohammed Laffar."

Petitioners sought a writ of certiorari quashing the notice issued under Section 04 of the Land Acquisition Act and the Gazette Extraordinary dated 04.10.2019. They also sought a writ of prohibition against the 3rd respondent from acting on the Minister's order under Proviso (a) to Section 38 of the Land Acquisition Act. Petitioners (1st petitioner: manageress, 2nd petitioner: chief occupant, 3rd petitioner: mother-in-law of 1st petitioner and mother of 2nd petitioner) claimed the hospital’s acquisition proceeded without addressing objections by the 3rd petitioner, contrary to Land Acquisition Act procedures. The learned state counsel contended that the land in question had been acquired under Section 38A of the Land Acquisition Act via Gazette Extraordinary 2143/54, due to urgency. Under Section 40, when an order by the minister under Section 38 is published, the land vests absolutely in the State free from all encumbrances. Thus, there was no issue of not giving an opportunity to raise objections. The learned state counsel cited the Jaffna district court case No. TR.55 and its order dated 29.04.1983, which did not include Doctor A. Umakanthan in the board of trustees. Petitioners acknowledged that the Supreme Court case No. 15/84 declared ""Nayanmarkaddu Ayurveda Vaidyasalai"" a public trust and ordered a management scheme. Petitioners denied initially but later admitted filing a document marked “X,” misrepresenting it to claim standing. The district court did not appoint Dr. A Umakanthan as a member of the Board of Trustees; instead, seven others were appointed. Petitioners’ misrepresentations reflect a lack of ""uberima fides."" According to the district court's order dated 29.04.1983, the Board of Trustees managed the hospital and its properties. In State Graphite Corporation v. Fernando and Another (1981) 2 Sri L.R 401 and Alphonso Appuhamy v. Hettiarachchi (1973) 77 NLR 131, it was held that failure to disclose material evidence disqualifies a petitioner from relief. Similarly, in Hulangamuwa v. Siriwardena and Others (1986) 1 Sri L.R. 275, a petitioner seeking extraordinary remedy must disclose every material fact. In Laub v. Attorney General and Another (1995) 2 Sri L.R. 88, suppression of material facts led to dismissal. The petitioners' misrepresentation of Dr. Umakanthan’s role and succession rights violates these principles. It is settled law that, on the basis of the suppression or misrepresentation of material facts alone, an application for writ could be dismissed. Consequently, the application for writs is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 60,000/-."

The Petitioner operated a retail liquor shop named ""Supreme Wine Stores,"" initially licensed in 1999 and continuously until 2017 at premises No. 89, Pujapitiya, Ankumbura. In March 2017, she was forced to close her business due to an order from the District Court of Kandy in Partition action No. P/5283. The business premises were allegedly vested with a relative of the 5th Respondent priest. The 4th Respondent directed her to relocate her business, leading her to lease new premises at No. 46, Alawathugoda Road, Ankumbura, and seek a license transfer, initially recommended by officials but later not due to public objections. She filed writ application No. Writ/116/2018, later withdrawn based on Respondent’s assurances. Subsequently, she leased premises at No. 232, Bamunupola, Batugoda, and applied again. The 2nd Respondent, after public objections and a panel inquiry, advised her to find another location. The Petitioner argued the refusal was unlawful, citing compliance with Gazette notification 'P 3' and claimed the refusal was arbitrary, unreasonable, and ultra vires, citing her legitimate expectation. The inquiry under Rule 21 of Excise Notification No. 902 found no violation, but the 1st Respondent failed to provide inquiry findings. De Smith’s Judicial Review and cases such as Samaraweera v. People's Bank and Karunadasa v. Unique Gem Stones Ltd. emphasize the necessity of reasons for decisions. Peiris v. Commissioner General of Excise notes locating a toddy tavern accessibly and cautions against protests by interested parties. The Court held 'P 16' unlawful, arbitrary, and ultra vires, issuing a writ of certiorari quashing it and granting the writ of mandamus for the liquor license transfer."
