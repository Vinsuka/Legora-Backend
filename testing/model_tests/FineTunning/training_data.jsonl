(“Praxis”), and (2) your separation from Praxis (the “Agreement”). This Agreement outlines the parties’ formal separation. You acknowledge that you are entering into this Agreement knowingly and voluntarily. It is customary in employment separation agreements for the departing employee to release the employer from any possible claims, even if the employer believes, as is the case here, that no such claims exist. By proposing and entering into this Agreement, Praxis is not admitting in any way that it violated any legal obligation that is or was owed to you. With those understandings, the parties agree as follows: 1. Separation from Employment This confirms that your employment with Praxis is ending effective on March 31, 2023 (the “Separation Date”). Praxis shall pay you (a) all wages that are due to you up to and through the Separation Date, (b) any expense reimbursements owed to you in accordance with the Praxis’ expense reimbursement policy and (c) any amount accrued and arising from your participation in, or benefits accrued under any employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements of Praxis, which amounts shall be payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of such employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements. If you apply to the Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance for unemployment compensation benefits under state law, Praxis shall not dispute your eligibility for such benefits. This shall not affect Praxis’ obligation to respond truthfully to governmental agency requests for information related to unemployment compensation eligibility. 2. Severance Benefits (a) Severance Pay. Based on your adherence to the covenants, representations, warranties and obligations set forth in this Agreement, Praxis agrees to pay you separation payments of $337,500.00 (“Severance Pay”), consisting of 9 months of salary. The Severance Pay will be paid to you in substantially equal installments on Praxis’ normal payroll schedule over the 9 month period following the Separation Date, beginning on the first payroll after the Effective Date of this Agreement, which initial payment shall include any amounts that otherwise would have been paid to prior to such first payroll date. The Severance Pay shall be subject to applicable deductions and withholdings. You will not receive any additional compensation from Praxis other than that which is specified herein. 16/04/2025, 06:20 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1033230 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1033230 1/10 (b) Health Benefits. If you elect COBRA continuation coverage, Praxis shall pay the same portion of premiums that it pays for active employees, for the same level of group coverage as in effect for you on the Separation Date, until the earliest of the following: (i) 9 months following the Separation Date; (ii) your eligibility for group coverage through other employment; or (iii) the end of your eligibility under COBRA for continuation coverage for medical care. You will be responsible for paying the remaining portion of the premiums for such coverage as if you remained employed. You agree to notify Praxis promptly if you become eligible for group coverage through another employer. You also agree to respond promptly and fully to Praxis regarding any reasonable requests for information concerning your eligibility for such coverage. You may continue coverage after the end of the Severance Pay period at your own expense for the remainder of the COBRA continuation period, subject to continued eligibility. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Praxis determines at any time that its payments pursuant to this subsection may be taxable income to you, it may convert such payments to payroll payments directly to you on Praxis\\' regular payroll dates, which shall be subject to tax-related deductions and withholdings. If Praxis determines that it cannot provide for COBRA coverage, it shall make such Special Cash Payments as described in Section 5.2(b) of your Employment Agreement. 3. Continuing Obligations You acknowledge that your obligations under your Employee Confidentiality, Assignment, and Nonsolicitation Agreement, executed by you on July 20, 2020 (“Confidentiality Agreement”), shall continue in full force and effect, including without limitation, your obligations to maintain the confidentiality of Proprietary Information as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement, to promptly return documents, and other property of Praxis and/or its affiliates, and to comply with your ongoing obligations regarding non-solicitation. A copy of the Confidentiality Agreement is attached as Exhibit A. You also acknowledge that your obligations regarding non-competition under your Noncompetition Agreement, attached hereto as Exhibit B, shall continue in full force and effect. Further, the Parties agree to incorporate into this Agreement the obligations further set out and attached hereto as Exhibit C with respect to non-solicitation obligations following the Separation Date (such obligations, together with the obligations set forth in Exhibit A and Exhibit B, the “Restrictive Covenants”). You further reaffirm and agree that you have at all times complied with and/or will continue to comply with the Restrictive Covenants. 4. Release of Claims In consideration of the Severance Pay, to which you acknowledge you would otherwise not be entitled, you voluntarily release and forever discharge Praxis, its affiliated and related entities, its and their respective predecessors, successors and assigns, its and their respective employee benefit plans and fiduciaries of such plans, and the current and former officers, directors, shareholders, employees, attorneys, accountants and agents of each of the foregoing in their official and personal capacities (collectively referred to as the “Releasees”) generally from all suits, claims, demands, debts, damages and liabilities of every name and nature, known or unknown (“Claim(s)”) that, as of the Separation Date, you have, ever had, now claim to have or ever claimed to have had against any or all of the Releasees.

Confidentiality of Agreement-Related Information You agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to keep all Agreement-Related Information completely confidential. “Agreement- Related Information” means any allegations of wrongful conduct by Praxis or any of its representatives, the negotiations leading to this Agreement and the existence and terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may disclose Agreement- Related Information to your spouse, your attorney and your financial advisors, provided that they first agree for the benefit of Praxis, to keep Agreement-Related Information confidential. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent you from disclosing Agreement-Related Information to the extent required by a lawfully issued subpoena or duly issued court order; provided that you provide Praxis with advance written notice and a reasonable opportunity to contest such subpoena or court order and that you share only the amount of Agreement-Related Information necessary to comply with such subpoena or duly issued court order. 6 Non-Disparagement You agree not to make any disparaging statements concerning Praxis or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, products, services or current or former directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents, successors and permitted assigns or subsidiaries of Praxis. 7. Protected Disclosures and Other Protected Actions Nothing contained in this Agreement limits your ability to file a charge or complaint with any federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (a “Government Agency”). In addition, nothing contained in this Agreement limits your ability to communicate with any Government Agency or otherwise participate in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any Government Agency, including your ability to provide documents or other information, without notice to Praxis, nor does anything contained in this Agreement apply to truthful testimony in litigation. If you file any charge or complaint with any Government Agency and if the Government Agency pursues any Claim on your behalf, or if any other third party pursues any Claim on your behalf, you waive any right to monetary or other individualized relief (either individually or as part of any collective or class action). In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, you shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law or under this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement for the disclosure of a trade secret that (a) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (b) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Neither the non-disclosure nor the non-disparagement obligations of this Agreement in any way limit your right, where applicable, to file or participate in an investigative proceeding conducted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and/or Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) or other federal or state regulatory or law enforcement agency or in any way affect your obligation to testify truthfully in any legal proceeding. 8. Other Provisions (a) Termination of Payments. If you breach any of your obligations under this Agreement, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies it may have for such breach, Praxis shall have the right to terminate any payments or health benefits to you or for your benefit under this Agreement. The termination of such payments or health benefits in the event of your breach will not affect your continuing obligations under this Agreement. 16/04/2025, 06:20 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1033230 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1033230 5/10 (b) Absence of Reliance. In signing this Agreement, you are not relying upon any promises or representations made by anyone at or on behalf of Praxis that are not captured herein. (c) Enforceability. If any portion or provision of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any portion or provision of any Section of this Agreement) shall to any extent be declared illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such portion or provision in circumstances other than those as to which it is so declared illegal or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each portion and provision of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. (d) Waiver. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by the waiving party. The failure of a party to require the performance of any term or obligation of this Agreement, or the waiver by a party of any breach of this Agreement, shall not prevent any subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach. (e) Relief. You agree that it would be difficult to measure any harm caused to Praxis that might result from any breach by you of your promises set forth in Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (the “Specified Sections”). You further agree that money damages would be an inadequate remedy for any breach of any of the Specified Sections. Accordingly, you agree that if you breach, or propose to breach, any portion of your obligations under any of the Specified Sections, Praxis shall be entitled, in addition to all other remedies it may have, to an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief to restrain any such breach, without showing or proving any actual damage to Praxis and without the necessity of posting a bond. If Praxis prevails in any action to enforce any of the Specified Sections, then you also shall be liable to Praxis for reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred by Praxis in enforcing any of the Specified Sections, except as to claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. (f) Governing Law; Venue; Interpretation. This Agreement shall be interpreted and enforced under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the federal and state courts located in Boston, Massachusetts (and the appropriate appellate courts therefrom), and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding, and irrevocably waives any objection based on inconvenient forum or lack of personal jurisdiction. In the event of any dispute, this Agreement is intended by the parties to be construed as a whole, to be interpreted in accordance with its fair meaning, and not to be construed strictly for or against either you or Praxis or the “drafter” of all or any portion of this Agreement. (g) Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Praxis. This Agreement supersedes any previous agreements or understandings between you and Praxis, except the Stock Option Documents, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Nonsolicitation Agreement and any other obligations specifically preserved in this Agreement. (h) Acknowledgment of Waiver of Claims under ADEA. You understand and acknowledge that you are waiving and releasing any rights you may have under the ADEA, and that this waiver and release is knowing and voluntary. You understand and agree that this waiver and release does not apply to any rights or claims that may arise under the ADEA after the date you sign this Agreement.

Confidentiality of Agreement-Related Information You agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to keep all Agreement-Related Information completely confidential. “Agreement- Related Information” means any allegations of wrongful conduct by Praxis or any of its representatives, the negotiations leading to this Agreement and the existence and terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may disclose Agreement- Related Information to your spouse, your attorney and your financial advisors, provided that they first agree for the benefit of Praxis, to keep Agreement-Related Information confidential. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent you from disclosing Agreement-Related Information to the extent required by a lawfully issued subpoena or duly issued court order; provided that you provide Praxis with advance written notice and a reasonable opportunity to contest such subpoena or court order and that you share only the amount of Agreement-Related Information necessary to comply with such subpoena or duly issued court order. 6 Non-Disparagement You agree not to make any disparaging statements concerning Praxis or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, products, services or current or former directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents, successors and permitted assigns or subsidiaries of Praxis. 7. Protected Disclosures and Other Protected Actions Nothing contained in this Agreement limits your ability to file a charge or complaint with any federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (a “Government Agency”). In addition, nothing contained in this Agreement limits your ability to communicate with any Government Agency or otherwise participate in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any Government Agency, including your ability to provide documents or other information, without notice to Praxis, nor does anything contained in this Agreement apply to truthful testimony in litigation. If you file any charge or complaint with any Government Agency and if the Government Agency pursues any Claim on your behalf, or if any other third party pursues any Claim on your behalf, you waive any right to monetary or other individualized relief (either individually or as part of any collective or class action). In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, you shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law or under this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement for the disclosure of a trade secret that (a) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (b) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.

(d) Waiver. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by the waiving party. The failure of a party to require the performance of any term or obligation of this Agreement, or the waiver by a party of any breach of this Agreement, shall not prevent any subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach.

(“Praxis”), and (2) your separation from Praxis (the “Agreement”). This Agreement outlines the parties’ formal separation. You acknowledge that you are entering into this Agreement knowingly and voluntarily. It is customary in employment separation agreements for the departing employee to release the employer from any possible claims, even if the employer believes, as is the case here, that no such claims exist. By proposing and entering into this Agreement, Praxis is not admitting in any way that it violated any legal obligation that is or was owed to you. With those understandings, the parties agree as follows: 1. Separation from Employment This confirms that your employment with Praxis is ending effective on March 31, 2023 (the “Separation Date”). Praxis shall pay you (a) all wages that are due to you up to and through the Separation Date, (b) any expense reimbursements owed to you in accordance with the Praxis’ expense reimbursement policy and (c) any amount accrued and arising from your participation in, or benefits accrued under any employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements of Praxis, which amounts shall be payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of such employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements. If you apply to the Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance for unemployment compensation benefits under state law, Praxis shall not dispute your eligibility for such benefits. This shall not affect Praxis’ obligation to respond truthfully to governmental agency requests for information related to unemployment compensation eligibility. 2. Severance Benefits (a) Severance Pay. Based on your adherence to the covenants, representations, warranties and obligations set forth in this Agreement, Praxis agrees to pay you separation payments of $337,500.00 (“Severance Pay”), consisting of 9 months of salary. The Severance Pay will be paid to you in substantially equal installments on Praxis’ normal payroll schedule over the 9 month period following the Separation Date, beginning on the first payroll after the Effective Date of this Agreement, which initial payment shall include any amounts that otherwise would have been paid to prior to such first payroll date. The Severance Pay shall be subject to applicable deductions and withholdings. You will not receive any additional compensation from Praxis other than that which is specified herein. 16/04/2025, 06:20 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1033230 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1033230 1/10 (b) Health Benefits. If you elect COBRA continuation coverage, Praxis shall pay the same portion of premiums that it pays for active employees, for the same level of group coverage as in effect for you on the Separation Date, until the earliest of the following: (i) 9 months following the Separation Date; (ii) your eligibility for group coverage through other employment; or (iii) the end of your eligibility under COBRA for continuation coverage for medical care. You will be responsible for paying the remaining portion of the premiums for such coverage as if you remained employed. You agree to notify Praxis promptly if you become eligible for group coverage through another employer. You also agree to respond promptly and fully to Praxis regarding any reasonable requests for information concerning your eligibility for such coverage. You may continue coverage after the end of the Severance Pay period at your own expense for the remainder of the COBRA continuation period, subject to continued eligibility. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Praxis determines at any time that its payments pursuant to this subsection may be taxable income to you, it may convert such payments to payroll payments directly to you on Praxis\\' regular payroll dates, which shall be subject to tax-related deductions and withholdings. If Praxis determines that it cannot provide for COBRA coverage, it shall make such Special Cash Payments as described in Section 5.2(b) of your Employment Agreement. 3. Continuing Obligations You acknowledge that your obligations under your Employee Confidentiality, Assignment, and Nonsolicitation Agreement, executed by you on July 20, 2020 (“Confidentiality Agreement”), shall continue in full force and effect, including without limitation, your obligations to maintain the confidentiality of Proprietary Information as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement, to promptly return documents, and other property of Praxis and/or its affiliates, and to comply with your ongoing obligations regarding non-solicitation. A copy of the Confidentiality Agreement is attached as Exhibit A. You also acknowledge that your obligations regarding non-competition under your Noncompetition Agreement, attached hereto as Exhibit B, shall continue in full force and effect. Further, the Parties agree to incorporate into this Agreement the obligations further set out and attached hereto as Exhibit C with respect to non-solicitation obligations following the Separation Date (such obligations, together with the obligations set forth in Exhibit A and Exhibit B, the “Restrictive Covenants”). You further reaffirm and agree that you have at all times complied with and/or will continue to comply with the Restrictive Covenants. 4. Release of Claims In consideration of the Severance Pay, to which you acknowledge you would otherwise not be entitled, you voluntarily release and forever discharge Praxis, its affiliated and related entities, its and their respective predecessors, successors and assigns, its and their respective employee benefit plans and fiduciaries of such plans, and the current and former officers, directors, shareholders, employees, attorneys, accountants and agents of each of the foregoing in their official and personal capacities (collectively referred to as the “Releasees”) generally from all suits, claims, demands, debts, damages and liabilities of every name and nature, known or unknown (“Claim(s)”) that, as of the Separation Date, you have, ever had, now claim to have or ever claimed to have had against any or all of the Releasees.

(i) Executive’ s covenants as set forth in this Section 7 are from time to time referred to herein as the “Executive Covenants .” If any Executive Covenant is ﬁnally held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable (whether in whole or in part), such Executive Covenant shall be deemed modiﬁed to the extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity , illegality or unenforceability and the remaining Executive Covenants shall not be affected thereby; provided , however , that if any Executive Covenant is ﬁnally held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable because it exceeds the maximum scope determined to be acceptable to permit such provision to be enforceable, such Executive Coven ant shall be deemed to be modiﬁed to the minimum extent necessary to modify such scope in order to make such provision enforceable hereunder . (ii) Executive acknowledges that the Company and its Afﬁliates have (A) expended and shall continue to expend substantial amounts of time, money and effort to develop business strategies, employee, customer and other relationships and goodwill to build an effective organizati on, and (B) a legitimate business interest in and right to protect their Conﬁdential Information, goodwill and employee, customer and other relationships. (iii) Executive understands that the Executive Covenants may limit Executive’ s ability to earn a livelihood in a business similar to the business of the Company , and Executive represents that Executive’ s experience and capabilities are such that Executive has other opportunities to earn a livelihood and adequate means of support for Executive and Executive’ s dependents. (iv) Any termination of (A) Executive’ s employment, (B) the Employment Period or (C) this Agreem ent shall have no effect on the continuing operation of this Section 7. (v) Executive acknowledges that the Company would be irreparably injured by a violation of this Section 7 and that it is impossible to measure in money the damages that shall accrue to the Company by reason of a failure by Executive to perform any of Executive’ s obligations under this Section 7. Accordingly , if the Company institutes any action or proceeding to enforce any of the provisions of this Section 7, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Executive hereby waives the claim or defense that the Company has an adequate remedy at law, and Executive shall not urge in any such action or proceeding the defense that any such remedy exists at law. Furthermore, in addition to other remedies that may be available,16/04/2025, 06:22 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 15/32-9-16/04/2025, 06:22 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 16/32-10-the Company shall be entitled (without the necessity of showing economic loss or other actual damage) to speciﬁc performance and other injunctive relief, without the requirement to post bond, in any court of competent jurisdiction for any actual or threaten ed breach of any of the covenants set forth in this Section 7. The Restricted Period shall be tolled during (and shall be deemed automatically extended by) any period during which Executive is in violation of the provisions of Section 7(c) or (d), as applicable. 8. Treatment of Certain Payments . (a) In the event that any payments or beneﬁts under this Agreement or otherwise, either alone or together with other payments or beneﬁts that Executive receives or is entitled to receive from the Company or any of its Afﬁliates (“Payments ”) would subject Executive to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Accounting Firm (as deﬁned below) shall determine whether to reduce any of the Payments paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement (the “Agreement Payments ”) so that the Parachute Value (as deﬁne d below) of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount (as deﬁned below). The Agreement Payments shall be so reduced only if the Accounting Firm determines that Executive would have a greater Net After -Tax Receipt (as deﬁned below) of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced. If the Accounting Firm determines that Executive would not have a greater Net After -Tax Receipt (as deﬁned below) of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced, Executive shall receive all Agreement Payments to which Executive is entitled hereunder . (b) If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Agreement Payments should be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, the Company shall promptly give Executive notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 8 shall be binding upon the Company and its Afﬁliates and Executive and shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than 15 days following the Date of Termination. For purposes of reducing the Agreement Payments so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and no other Payments) shall be reduced. The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder , if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments and beneﬁts under the following sections in the following order: (i) cash payments that may not be valued under Treas. Reg. § 1.280G-1, Q&A-24(c) (“24(c) ”); (ii) equity-based payments that may not be valued under 24(c); (iii) cash payments that may be valued under 24(c); (iv) equity-based payments that may be valued under 24(c); and (v) other types of beneﬁts. With respect to each category of the foregoing, such reduction shall occur ﬁrst with respect to amounts that are not “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and next with respect to payments that are deferred compensation, in each case, beginning with payment s or beneﬁts that are to be paid the farthest in time from the determination of the Accounting Firm. All reasonable fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company . (c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder , it is possible that amounts shall have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive pursuant to this Agreement that should not have been so paid or distributed (each, an16/04/2025, 06:22 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 17/32-11-“Overpayment ”) or that additional amounts that shall have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed (each, an “Underpayment ”), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder . In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a deﬁciency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Company or Executive that the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive shall be repaid by Executive to the Company (as applicable) together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided , however , that no such repayment shall be required if and to the extent such deemed repayment would not either reduce the amount on which Executive is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority , determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f) (2) of the Code. (d) To the extent requested by Executive, the Company shall cooperate with Executive in good faith in valuing, and the Accounting Firm shall take into account the value of, services provided or to be provided by Executive (including Executive’ s agreeing to refrain from performing services pursuant to a cove nant not to compete or similar covenant, before, on or after the date of a change in ownership or control of the Company (within the meaning of Q&A- 2(b) of the ﬁnal regulations under Section 280G of the Code), such that payments in respect of such services may be considered reasonable compensation within the meaning of Q&A-9 and Q&A-40 to Q&A-44 of the ﬁnal regulations under Section 280G of the Code and/or exempt from the deﬁnition of the term “parachute payment” within the meaning of Q&A-2(a) of the ﬁnal regulations under Section 280G of the Code in accordance with Q&A- 5(a) of the ﬁnal regulations under Section 280G of the Code.

(ii) “Net After -Tax Receipt ” shall mean the present value (as determined in accordance with Sections 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 280G(d)(4) of the Code) of a Payment net of all taxes imposed on Executive with respect thereto under Sections 1 and 4999 of the Code and under applicable state and local laws, determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section 1 of the Code and under state and local laws which applied to Executive’ s taxable income for the immediately preceding taxable year, or such other rate(s) as the Accounting Firm determines to be likely to apply to Executive in the relevant tax year(s).16/04/2025, 06:22 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 18/3216/04/2025, 06:22 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 19/32-12-(iii) “Parachute Value” of a Payment shall mean the present value as of the date of the change of control for purposes of Section 280G of the Code of the portion of such Payment that constitutes a “parachute payment” under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, as determined by the Accounting Firm for purposes of determining whether and to what extent the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code shall apply to such Payment.

(a) In the event that any payments or beneﬁts under this Agreement or otherwise, either alone or together with other payments or beneﬁts that Executive receives or is entitled to receive from the Company or any of its Afﬁliates (“Payments ”) would subject Executive to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Accounting Firm (as deﬁned below) shall determine whether to reduce any of the Payments paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement (the “Agreement Payments ”) so that the Parachute Value (as deﬁne d below) of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount (as deﬁned below). The Agreement Payments shall be so reduced only if the Accounting Firm determines that Executive would have a greater Net After -Tax Receipt (as deﬁned below) of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced. If the Accounting Firm determines that Executive would not have a greater Net After -Tax Receipt (as deﬁned below) of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced, Executive shall receive all Agreement Payments to which Executive is entitled hereunder . (b) If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Agreement Payments should be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, the Company shall promptly give Executive notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 8 shall be binding upon the Company and its Afﬁliates and Executive and shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than 15 days following the Date of Termination. For purposes of reducing the Agreement Payments so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and no other Payments) shall be reduced. The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder , if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments and beneﬁts under the following sections in the following order: (i) cash payments that may not be valued under Treas. Reg. § 1.280G-1, Q&A-24(c) (“24(c) ”); (ii) equity-based payments that may not be valued under 24(c); (iii) cash payments that may be valued under 24(c); (iv) equity-based payments that may be valued under 24(c); and (v) other types of beneﬁts. With respect to each category of the foregoing, such reduction shall occur ﬁrst with respect to amounts that are not “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and next with respect to payments that are deferred compensation, in each case, beginning with payment s or beneﬁts that are to be paid the farthest in time from the determination of the Accounting Firm. All reasonable fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company . (c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder , it is possible that amounts shall have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive pursuant to this Agreement that should not have been so paid or distributed (each, an16/04/2025, 06:22 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 17/32-11-“Overpayment ”) or that additional amounts that shall have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed (each, an “Underpayment ”), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder . In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a deﬁciency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Company or Executive that the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive shall be repaid by Executive to the Company (as applicable) together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided , however , that no such repayment shall be required if and to the extent such deemed repayment would not either reduce the amount on which Executive is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority , determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f) (2) of the Code. (d) To the extent requested by Executive, the Company shall cooperate with Executive in good faith in valuing, and the Accounting Firm shall take into account the value of, services provided or to be provided by Executive (including Executive’ s agreeing to refrain from performing services pursuant to a cove nant not to compete or similar covenant, before, on or after the date of a change in ownership or control of the Company (within the meaning of Q&A- 2(b) of the ﬁnal regulations under Section 280G of the Code), such that payments in respect of such services may be considered reasonable compensation within the meaning of Q&A-9 and Q&A-40 to Q&A-44 of the ﬁnal regulations under Section 280G of the Code and/or exempt from the deﬁnition of the term “parachute payment” within the meaning of Q&A-2(a) of the ﬁnal regulations under Section 280G of the Code in accordance with Q&A- 5(a) of the ﬁnal regulations under Section 280G of the Code. (e) The following terms shall have the following meanings for purposes of this Section 8: (i) “Accounting Firm ” shall mean a nationally recognized certiﬁed public accounting ﬁrm or other professional organization that is recognized as an expert in determinations and calculations for purposes of Section 280G of the Code that is selected by the Company prior to the transaction resulting in the application (or potential application) of Section 280G of the Code for purposes of making the applicable determinations hereunder , which ﬁrm shall not, without Executive’ s consent, be a ﬁrm serving as accountant or auditor for the person ef fecting such transaction. (ii) “Net After -Tax Receipt ” shall mean the present value (as determined in accordance with Sections 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 280G(d)(4) of the Code) of a Payment net of all taxes imposed on Executive with respect thereto under Sections 1 and 4999 of the Code and under applicable state and local laws, determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section 1 of the Code and under state and local laws which applied to Executive’ s taxable income for the immediately preceding taxable year, or such other rate(s) as the Accounting Firm determines to be likely to apply to Executive in the relevant tax year(s).16/04/2025, 06:22 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 18/3216/04/2025, 06:22 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 19/32-12-(iii) “Parachute Value” of a Payment shall mean the present value as of the date of the change of control for purposes of Section 280G of the Code of the portion of such Payment that constitutes a “parachute payment” under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, as determined by the Accounting Firm for purposes of determining whether and to what extent the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code shall apply to such Payment.

The Restricted Period shall be tolled during (and shall be deemed automatically extended by) any period during which Executive is in violation of the provisions of Section 7(c) or (d), as applicable. 8. Treatment of Certain Payments . (a) In the event that any payments or beneﬁts under this Agreement or otherwise, either alone or together with other payments or beneﬁts that Executive receives or is entitled to receive from the Company or any of its Afﬁliates (“Payments ”) would subject Executive to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Accounting Firm (as deﬁned below) shall determine whether to reduce any of the Payments paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement (the “Agreement Payments ”) so that the Parachute Value (as deﬁne d below) of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount (as deﬁned below). The Agreement Payments shall be so reduced only if the Accounting Firm determines that Executive would have a greater Net After -Tax Receipt (as deﬁned below) of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced. If the Accounting Firm determines that Executive would not have a greater Net After -Tax Receipt (as deﬁned below) of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced, Executive shall receive all Agreement Payments to which Executive is entitled hereunder . (b) If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Agreement Payments should be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, the Company shall promptly give Executive notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 8 shall be binding upon the Company and its Afﬁliates and Executive and shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than 15 days following the Date of Termination. For purposes of reducing the Agreement Payments so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and no other Payments) shall be reduced. The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder , if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments and beneﬁts under the following sections in the following order: (i) cash payments that may not be valued under Treas. Reg. § 1.280G-1, Q&A-24(c) (“24(c) ”); (ii) equity-based payments that may not be valued under 24(c); (iii) cash payments that may be valued under 24(c); (iv) equity-based payments that may be valued under 24(c); and (v) other types of beneﬁts. With respect to each category of the foregoing, such reduction shall occur ﬁrst with respect to amounts that are not “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and next with respect to payments that are deferred compensation, in each case, beginning with payment s or beneﬁts that are to be paid the farthest in time from the determination of the Accounting Firm. All reasonable fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company . (c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder , it is possible that amounts shall have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive pursuant to this Agreement that should not have been so paid or distributed (each, an16/04/2025, 06:22 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 17/32-11-“Overpayment ”) or that additional amounts that shall have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed (each, an “Underpayment ”), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder .

The Restricted Period shall be tolled during (and shall be deemed automatically extended by) any period during which Executive is in violation of the provisions of Section 7(c) or (d), as applicable. 8. Treatment of Certain Payments . (a) In the event that any payments or beneﬁts under this Agreement or otherwise, either alone or together with other payments or beneﬁts that Executive receives or is entitled to receive from the Company or any of its Afﬁliates (“Payments ”) would subject Executive to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Accounting Firm (as deﬁned below) shall determine whether to reduce any of the Payments paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement (the “Agreement Payments ”) so that the Parachute Value (as deﬁne d below) of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount (as deﬁned below). The Agreement Payments shall be so reduced only if the Accounting Firm determines that Executive would have a greater Net After -Tax Receipt (as deﬁned below) of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced. If the Accounting Firm determines that Executive would not have a greater Net After -Tax Receipt (as deﬁned below) of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced, Executive shall receive all Agreement Payments to which Executive is entitled hereunder . (b) If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Agreement Payments should be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, the Company shall promptly give Executive notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 8 shall be binding upon the Company and its Afﬁliates and Executive and shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than 15 days following the Date of Termination. For purposes of reducing the Agreement Payments so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and no other Payments) shall be reduced. The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder , if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments and beneﬁts under the following sections in the following order: (i) cash payments that may not be valued under Treas. Reg. § 1.280G-1, Q&A-24(c) (“24(c) ”); (ii) equity-based payments that may not be valued under 24(c); (iii) cash payments that may be valued under 24(c); (iv) equity-based payments that may be valued under 24(c); and (v) other types of beneﬁts. With respect to each category of the foregoing, such reduction shall occur ﬁrst with respect to amounts that are not “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and next with respect to payments that are deferred compensation, in each case, beginning with payment s or beneﬁts that are to be paid the farthest in time from the determination of the Accounting Firm. All reasonable fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company . (c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder , it is possible that amounts shall have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive pursuant to this Agreement that should not have been so paid or distributed (each, an16/04/2025, 06:22 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034254 17/32-11-“Overpayment ”) or that additional amounts that shall have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed (each, an “Underpayment ”), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder . In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a deﬁciency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Company or Executive that the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive shall be repaid by Executive to the Company (as applicable) together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided , however , that no such repayment shall be required if and to the extent such deemed repayment would not either reduce the amount on which Executive is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority , determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f) (2) of the Code.

(“Praxis”), and (2) your separation from Praxis (the “Agreement”). This Agreement outlines the parties’ formal separation. You acknowledge that you are entering into this Agreement knowingly and voluntarily. It is customary in employment separation agreements for the departing employee to release the employer from any possible claims, even if the employer believes, as is the case here, that no such claims exist. By proposing and entering into this Agreement, Praxis is not admitting in any way that it violated any legal obligation that is or was owed to you. With those understandings, the parties agree as follows: 1. Separation from Employment This confirms that your employment with Praxis is ending effective on March 31, 2023 (the “Separation Date”). Praxis shall pay you (a) all wages that are due to you up to and through the Separation Date, (b) any expense reimbursements owed to you in accordance with the Praxis’ expense reimbursement policy and (c) any amount accrued and arising from your participation in, or benefits accrued under any employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements of Praxis, which amounts shall be payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of such employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements. If you apply to the Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance for unemployment compensation benefits under state law, Praxis shall not dispute your eligibility for such benefits. This shall not affect Praxis’ obligation to respond truthfully to governmental agency requests for information related to unemployment compensation eligibility. 2. Severance Benefits (a) Severance Pay. Based on your adherence to the covenants, representations, warranties and obligations set forth in this Agreement, Praxis agrees to pay you separation payments of $337,500.00 (“Severance Pay”), consisting of 9 months of salary. The Severance Pay will be paid to you in substantially equal installments on Praxis’ normal payroll schedule over the 9 month period following the Separation Date, beginning on the first payroll after the Effective Date of this Agreement, which initial payment shall include any amounts that otherwise would have been paid to prior to such first payroll date. The Severance Pay shall be subject to applicable deductions and withholdings. You will not receive any additional compensation from Praxis other than that which is specified herein. 16/04/2025, 06:20 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1033230 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1033230 1/10 (b) Health Benefits. If you elect COBRA continuation coverage, Praxis shall pay the same portion of premiums that it pays for active employees, for the same level of group coverage as in effect for you on the Separation Date, until the earliest of the following: (i) 9 months following the Separation Date; (ii) your eligibility for group coverage through other employment; or (iii) the end of your eligibility under COBRA for continuation coverage for medical care. You will be responsible for paying the remaining portion of the premiums for such coverage as if you remained employed. You agree to notify Praxis promptly if you become eligible for group coverage through another employer. You also agree to respond promptly and fully to Praxis regarding any reasonable requests for information concerning your eligibility for such coverage. You may continue coverage after the end of the Severance Pay period at your own expense for the remainder of the COBRA continuation period, subject to continued eligibility. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Praxis determines at any time that its payments pursuant to this subsection may be taxable income to you, it may convert such payments to payroll payments directly to you on Praxis\\' regular payroll dates, which shall be subject to tax-related deductions and withholdings. If Praxis determines that it cannot provide for COBRA coverage, it shall make such Special Cash Payments as described in Section 5.2(b) of your Employment Agreement. 3. Continuing Obligations You acknowledge that your obligations under your Employee Confidentiality, Assignment, and Nonsolicitation Agreement, executed by you on July 20, 2020 (“Confidentiality Agreement”), shall continue in full force and effect, including without limitation, your obligations to maintain the confidentiality of Proprietary Information as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement, to promptly return documents, and other property of Praxis and/or its affiliates, and to comply with your ongoing obligations regarding non-solicitation. A copy of the Confidentiality Agreement is attached as Exhibit A. You also acknowledge that your obligations regarding non-competition under your Noncompetition Agreement, attached hereto as Exhibit B, shall continue in full force and effect. Further, the Parties agree to incorporate into this Agreement the obligations further set out and attached hereto as Exhibit C with respect to non-solicitation obligations following the Separation Date (such obligations, together with the obligations set forth in Exhibit A and Exhibit B, the “Restrictive Covenants”). You further reaffirm and agree that you have at all times complied with and/or will continue to comply with the Restrictive Covenants. 4.

Confidentiality of Agreement-Related Information You agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to keep all Agreement-Related Information completely confidential. “Agreement- Related Information” means any allegations of wrongful conduct by Praxis or any of its representatives, the negotiations leading to this Agreement and the existence and terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may disclose Agreement- Related Information to your spouse, your attorney and your financial advisors, provided that they first agree for the benefit of Praxis, to keep Agreement-Related Information confidential. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent you from disclosing Agreement-Related Information to the extent required by a lawfully issued subpoena or duly issued court order; provided that you provide Praxis with advance written notice and a reasonable opportunity to contest such subpoena or court order and that you share only the amount of Agreement-Related Information necessary to comply with such subpoena or duly issued court order. 6 Non-Disparagement You agree not to make any disparaging statements concerning Praxis or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, products, services or current or former directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents, successors and permitted assigns or subsidiaries of Praxis. 7. Protected Disclosures and Other Protected Actions Nothing contained in this Agreement limits your ability to file a charge or complaint with any federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (a “Government Agency”). In addition, nothing contained in this Agreement limits your ability to communicate with any Government Agency or otherwise participate in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any Government Agency, including your ability to provide documents or other information, without notice to Praxis, nor does anything contained in this Agreement apply to truthful testimony in litigation. If you file any charge or complaint with any Government Agency and if the Government Agency pursues any Claim on your behalf, or if any other third party pursues any Claim on your behalf, you waive any right to monetary or other individualized relief (either individually or as part of any collective or class action). In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, you shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law or under this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement for the disclosure of a trade secret that (a) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (b) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.

Other Provisions (a) Termination of Payments. If you breach any of your obligations under this Agreement, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies it may have for such breach, Praxis shall have the right to terminate any payments or health benefits to you or for your benefit under this Agreement. The termination of such payments or health benefits in the event of your breach will not affect your continuing obligations under this Agreement. 16/04/2025, 06:20 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1033230 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1033230 5/10 (b) Absence of Reliance.

If any portion or provision of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any portion or provision of any Section of this Agreement) shall to any extent be declared illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such portion or provision in circumstances other than those as to which it is so declared illegal or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each portion and provision of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. (d) Waiver. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by the waiving party. The failure of a party to require the performance of any term or obligation of this Agreement, or the waiver by a party of any breach of this Agreement, shall not prevent any subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach. (e) Relief. You agree that it would be difficult to measure any harm caused to Praxis that might result from any breach by you of your promises set forth in Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (the “Specified Sections”). You further agree that money damages would be an inadequate remedy for any breach of any of the Specified Sections. Accordingly, you agree that if you breach, or propose to breach, any portion of your obligations under any of the Specified Sections, Praxis shall be entitled, in addition to all other remedies it may have, to an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief to restrain any such breach, without showing or proving any actual damage to Praxis and without the necessity of posting a bond. If Praxis prevails in any action to enforce any of the Specified Sections, then you also shall be liable to Praxis for reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred by Praxis in enforcing any of the Specified Sections, except as to claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. (f) Governing Law; Venue; Interpretation. This Agreement shall be interpreted and enforced under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the federal and state courts located in Boston, Massachusetts (and the appropriate appellate courts therefrom), and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding, and irrevocably waives any objection based on inconvenient forum or lack of personal jurisdiction. In the event of any dispute, this Agreement is intended by the parties to be construed as a whole, to be interpreted in accordance with its fair meaning, and not to be construed strictly for or against either you or Praxis or the “drafter” of all or any portion of this Agreement. (g) Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Praxis. This Agreement supersedes any previous agreements or understandings between you and Praxis, except the Stock Option Documents, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Nonsolicitation Agreement and any other obligations specifically preserved in this Agreement. (h) Acknowledgment of Waiver of Claims under ADEA. You understand and acknowledge that you are waiving and releasing any rights you may have under the ADEA, and that this waiver and release is knowing and voluntary.

(“Praxis”), and (2) your separation from Praxis (the “Agreement”). This Agreement outlines the parties’ formal separation. You acknowledge that you are entering into this Agreement knowingly and voluntarily. It is customary in employment separation agreements for the departing employee to release the employer from any possible claims, even if the employer believes, as is the case here, that no such claims exist. By proposing and entering into this Agreement, Praxis is not admitting in any way that it violated any legal obligation that is or was owed to you. With those understandings, the parties agree as follows: 1. Separation from Employment This confirms that your employment with Praxis is ending effective on March 31, 2023 (the “Separation Date”). Praxis shall pay you (a) all wages that are due to you up to and through the Separation Date, (b) any expense reimbursements owed to you in accordance with the Praxis’ expense reimbursement policy and (c) any amount accrued and arising from your participation in, or benefits accrued under any employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements of Praxis, which amounts shall be payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of such employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements. If you apply to the Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance for unemployment compensation benefits under state law, Praxis shall not dispute your eligibility for such benefits. This shall not affect Praxis’ obligation to respond truthfully to governmental agency requests for information related to unemployment compensation eligibility. 2. Severance Benefits (a) Severance Pay. Based on your adherence to the covenants, representations, warranties and obligations set forth in this Agreement, Praxis agrees to pay you separation payments of $337,500.00 (“Severance Pay”), consisting of 9 months of salary. The Severance Pay will be paid to you in substantially equal installments on Praxis’ normal payroll schedule over the 9 month period following the Separation Date, beginning on the first payroll after the Effective Date of this Agreement, which initial payment shall include any amounts that otherwise would have been paid to prior to such first payroll date. The Severance Pay shall be subject to applicable deductions and withholdings. You will not receive any additional compensation from Praxis other than that which is specified herein. 16/04/2025, 06:20 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1033230 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1033230 1/10 (b) Health Benefits. If you elect COBRA continuation coverage, Praxis shall pay the same portion of premiums that it pays for active employees, for the same level of group coverage as in effect for you on the Separation Date, until the earliest of the following: (i) 9 months following the Separation Date; (ii) your eligibility for group coverage through other employment; or (iii) the end of your eligibility under COBRA for continuation coverage for medical care. You will be responsible for paying the remaining portion of the premiums for such coverage as if you remained employed. You agree to notify Praxis promptly if you become eligible for group coverage through another employer. You also agree to respond promptly and fully to Praxis regarding any reasonable requests for information concerning your eligibility for such coverage. You may continue coverage after the end of the Severance Pay period at your own expense for the remainder of the COBRA continuation period, subject to continued eligibility. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Praxis determines at any time that its payments pursuant to this subsection may be taxable income to you, it may convert such payments to payroll payments directly to you on Praxis\\' regular payroll dates, which shall be subject to tax-related deductions and withholdings. If Praxis determines that it cannot provide for COBRA coverage, it shall make such Special Cash Payments as described in Section 5.2(b) of your Employment Agreement. 3. Continuing Obligations You acknowledge that your obligations under your Employee Confidentiality, Assignment, and Nonsolicitation Agreement, executed by you on July 20, 2020 (“Confidentiality Agreement”), shall continue in full force and effect, including without limitation, your obligations to maintain the confidentiality of Proprietary Information as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement, to promptly return documents, and other property of Praxis and/or its affiliates, and to comply with your ongoing obligations regarding non-solicitation. A copy of the Confidentiality Agreement is attached as Exhibit A. You also acknowledge that your obligations regarding non-competition under your Noncompetition Agreement, attached hereto as Exhibit B, shall continue in full force and effect. Further, the Parties agree to incorporate into this Agreement the obligations further set out and attached hereto as Exhibit C with respect to non-solicitation obligations following the Separation Date (such obligations, together with the obligations set forth in Exhibit A and Exhibit B, the “Restrictive Covenants”). You further reaffirm and agree that you have at all times complied with and/or will continue to comply with the Restrictive Covenants. 4. Release of Claims In consideration of the Severance Pay, to which you acknowledge you would otherwise not be entitled, you voluntarily release and forever discharge Praxis, its affiliated and related entities, its and their respective predecessors, successors and assigns, its and their respective employee benefit plans and fiduciaries of such plans, and the current and former officers, directors, shareholders, employees, attorneys, accountants and agents of each of the foregoing in their official and personal capacities (collectively referred to as the “Releasees”) generally from all suits, claims, demands, debts, damages and liabilities of every name and nature, known or unknown (“Claim(s)”) that, as of the Separation Date, you have, ever had, now claim to have or ever claimed to have had against any or all of the Releasees.

In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary , nothing in this Agreement shall impair Executive’ s rights under the whistleblow er provisions of any applicable federal law or regulation or, for the avoidance of doubt, limit Executive’ s right to receive an award for information provided to any government authority under such law or regulation. (h) Executive Covenants Generally . (i) Executive’ s covenants as set forth in this Section 7 are from time to time referred to herein as the “Executive Covenants .” If any Executive Covenant is ﬁnally held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable (whether in whole or in part), such Executive Covenant shall be deemed modiﬁed to the extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity , illegality or unenforceability and the remaining Executive Covenants shall not be affected thereby; provided , however , that if any Executive Covenant is ﬁnally held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable because it exceeds the maximum scope determined to be acceptable to permit such provision to be enforceable, such Executive Coven ant shall be deemed to be modiﬁed to the minimum extent necessary to modify such scope in order to make such provision enforceable hereunder . (ii) Executive acknowledges that the Company and its Afﬁliates have (A) expended and shall continue to expend substantial amounts of time, money and effort to develop business strategies, employee, customer and other relationships and goodwill to build an effective organizati on, and (B) a legitimate business interest in and right to protect their Conﬁdential Information, goodwill and employee, customer and other relationships. (iii) Executive understands that the Executive Covenants may limit Executive’ s ability to earn a livelihood in a business similar to the business of the Company , and Executive represents that Executive’ s experience and capabilities are such that Executive has other opportunities to earn a livelihood and adequate means of support for Executive and Executive’ s dependents. (iv) Any termination of (A) Executive’ s employment, (B) the Employment Period or (C) this Agreem ent shall have no effect on the continuing operation of this Section 7. (v) Executive acknowledges that the Company would be irreparably injured by a violation of this Section 7 and that it is impossible to measure in money the damages that shall accrue to the Company by reason of a failure by Executive to perform any of Executive’ s obligations under this Section 7. Accordingly , if the Company institutes any action or proceeding to enforce any of the provisions of this Section 7, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Executive hereby waives the claim or defense that the Company has an adequate remedy at law, and Executive shall not urge in any such action or proceeding the defense that any such remedy exists at law. Furthermore, in addition to other remedies that may be available, the Company shall be entitled (without the necessity of showing economic loss or other actual damage) to speciﬁc performance and other injunctive relief, without the requirement to post bond, in any court of competent jurisdiction for any actual or threatened breach of any of the covenants set forth in this Section 7.

Treatment of Certain Payments . (a) In the event that any payments or beneﬁts under this Agreement or otherwise, either alone or together with other payments or beneﬁts that Executive receives or is entitled to receive from the Company or any of its Afﬁliates (“Payments ”) would subject Executive to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Accounting Firm (as deﬁned below) shall determine whether to reduce any of the Payments paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement (the “Agreement Payments ”) so that the Parachute Value (as deﬁned below) of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount (as deﬁned below). The Agreement Payments shall be so reduced only if the Accounting Firm determines that Executive would have a greater Net After -Tax Receipt (as deﬁned below) of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced. If the Accounting Firm determines that Executive would not have a greater Net After -Tax Receipt (as deﬁned below) of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced, Executive shall receive all Agreement Payments to which Executive is entitled hereunder . (b) If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Agreement Payments should be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, the Company shall promptly give Executive notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 8 shall be binding upon the Company and its Afﬁliates and Executive and shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than 15 days following the Date of Termination. For purposes of reducing the Agreement Payments so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and no other Payments) shall be reduced. The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder , if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments and beneﬁts under the following sections in the following order: (i) cash payments that may not be valued under Treas. Reg. § 1.280G-1, Q&A-24(c) (“24(c) ”); (ii) equity-based payments that may not be valued under 24(c); (iii) cash payments that may be valued under 24(c); (iv) equity-based payments that may be valued under 24(c); and (v) other types of beneﬁts. With respect to each category of the foregoing, such reduction shall occur ﬁrst with respect to amounts that are not “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and next with respect to payments that are deferred compensation, in each case, beginning with payment s or beneﬁts that are to be paid the farthest in time from the determination of the Accounting Firm. All reasonable fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company . (c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder , it is possible that amounts shall have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive pursuant to this Agreement that shou ld not have been so paid or distributed (each, an “Overpayment ”) or that additional amounts that shall have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed (each, an “Underpayment ”), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder . In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a16/04/2025, 06:08 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034255 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034255 16/30-11-deﬁciency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Company or Executive that the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive shall be repaid by Executive to the Company (as applicable) together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided , however , that no such repayment shall be required if and to the extent such deemed repayment would not either reduce the amount on which Executive is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority , determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f) (2) of the Code. (d) To the extent requested by Executive, the Company shall cooperate with Executive in good faith in valuing, and the Accounting Firm shall take into account the value of, services provided or to be provided by Executive (including Executive’ s agreeing to refrain from performing services pursuant to a cove nant not to compete or similar covenant, before, on or after the date of a change in ownership or control of the Company (within the meaning of Q&A- 2(b) of the ﬁnal regulations under Section 280G of the Code), such that payments in respect of such services may be considered reasonable compensation within the meaning of Q&A-9 and Q&A-40 to Q&A-44 of the ﬁnal regulations under Section 280G of the Code and/or exempt from the deﬁnition of the term “parachute payment” within the meaning of Q&A-2(a) of the ﬁnal regulations under Section 280G of the Code in accordance with Q&A- 5(a) of the ﬁnal regulations under Section 280G of the Code.

(iii) “Parachute Value” of a Payment shall mean the present value as of the date of the change of control for purposes of Section 280G of the Code of the portion of such Payment that constitutes a “parachute payment” under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, as16/04/2025, 06:08 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034255 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034255 17/3016/04/2025, 06:08 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034255 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034255 18/30-12-determined by the Accounting Firm for purposes of determining whether and to what extent the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code shall apply to such Payment.

(a) In the event that any payments or beneﬁts under this Agreement or otherwise, either alone or together with other payments or beneﬁts that Executive receives or is entitled to receive from the Company or any of its Afﬁliates (“Payments ”) would subject Executive to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Accounting Firm (as deﬁned below) shall determine whether to reduce any of the Payments paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement (the “Agreement Payments ”) so that the Parachute Value (as deﬁned below) of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount (as deﬁned below). The Agreement Payments shall be so reduced only if the Accounting Firm determines that Executive would have a greater Net After -Tax Receipt (as deﬁned below) of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced. If the Accounting Firm determines that Executive would not have a greater Net After -Tax Receipt (as deﬁned below) of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced, Executive shall receive all Agreement Payments to which Executive is entitled hereunder . (b) If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Agreement Payments should be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, the Company shall promptly give Executive notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 8 shall be binding upon the Company and its Afﬁliates and Executive and shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than 15 days following the Date of Termination. For purposes of reducing the Agreement Payments so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and no other Payments) shall be reduced. The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder , if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments and beneﬁts under the following sections in the following order: (i) cash payments that may not be valued under Treas. Reg. § 1.280G-1, Q&A-24(c) (“24(c) ”); (ii) equity-based payments that may not be valued under 24(c); (iii) cash payments that may be valued under 24(c); (iv) equity-based payments that may be valued under 24(c); and (v) other types of beneﬁts. With respect to each category of the foregoing, such reduction shall occur ﬁrst with respect to amounts that are not “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and next with respect to payments that are deferred compensation, in each case, beginning with payment s or beneﬁts that are to be paid the farthest in time from the determination of the Accounting Firm. All reasonable fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company . (c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder , it is possible that amounts shall have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive pursuant to this Agreement that shou ld not have been so paid or distributed (each, an “Overpayment ”) or that additional amounts that shall have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed (each, an “Underpayment ”), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder . In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a16/04/2025, 06:08 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034255 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034255 16/30-11-deﬁciency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Company or Executive that the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive shall be repaid by Executive to the Company (as applicable) together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided , however , that no such repayment shall be required if and to the extent such deemed repayment would not either reduce the amount on which Executive is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority , determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f) (2) of the Code. (d) To the extent requested by Executive, the Company shall cooperate with Executive in good faith in valuing, and the Accounting Firm shall take into account the value of, services provided or to be provided by Executive (including Executive’ s agreeing to refrain from performing services pursuant to a cove nant not to compete or similar covenant, before, on or after the date of a change in ownership or control of the Company (within the meaning of Q&A- 2(b) of the ﬁnal regulations under Section 280G of the Code), such that payments in respect of such services may be considered reasonable compensation within the meaning of Q&A-9 and Q&A-40 to Q&A-44 of the ﬁnal regulations under Section 280G of the Code and/or exempt from the deﬁnition of the term “parachute payment” within the meaning of Q&A-2(a) of the ﬁnal regulations under Section 280G of the Code in accordance with Q&A- 5(a) of the ﬁnal regulations under Section 280G of the Code.

(iii) “Parachute Value” of a Payment shall mean the present value as of the date of the change of control for purposes of Section 280G of the Code of the portion of such Payment that constitutes a “parachute payment” under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, as16/04/2025, 06:08 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034255 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034255 17/3016/04/2025, 06:08 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034255 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1034255 18/30-12-determined by the Accounting Firm for purposes of determining whether and to what extent the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code shall apply to such Payment.

(iv) Any termination of (A) Executive’ s employment, (B) the Employment Period or (C) this Agreem ent shall have no effect on the continuing operation of this Section 7. (v) Executive acknowledges that the Company would be irreparably injured by a violation of this Section 7 and that it is impossible to measure in money the damages that shall accrue to the Company by reason of a failure by Executive to perform any of Executive’ s obligations under this Section 7.

Treatment of Certain Payments . (a) In the event that any payments or beneﬁts under this Agreement or otherwise, either alone or together with other payments or beneﬁts that Executive receives or is entitled to receive from the Company or any of its Afﬁliates (“Payments ”) would subject Executive to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Accounting Firm (as deﬁned below) shall determine whether to reduce any of the Payments paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement (the “Agreement Payments ”) so that the Parachute Value (as deﬁned below) of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount (as deﬁned below). The Agreement Payments shall be so reduced only if the Accounting Firm determines that Executive would have a greater Net After -Tax Receipt (as deﬁned below) of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced. If the Accounting Firm determines that Executive would not have a greater Net After -Tax Receipt (as deﬁned below) of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced, Executive shall receive all Agreement Payments to which Executive is entitled hereunder . (b) If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Agreement Payments should be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, the Company shall promptly give Executive notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 8 shall be binding upon the Company and its Afﬁliates and Executive and shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than 15 days following the Date of Termination. For purposes of reducing the Agreement Payments so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and no other Payments) shall be reduced. The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder , if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments and beneﬁts under the following sections in the following order: (i) cash payments that may not be valued under Treas. Reg. § 1.280G-1, Q&A-24(c) (“24(c) ”); (ii) equity-based payments that may not be valued under 24(c); (iii) cash payments that may be valued under 24(c); (iv) equity-based payments that may be valued under 24(c); and (v) other types of beneﬁts. With respect to each category of the foregoing, such reduction shall occur ﬁrst with respect to amounts that are not “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and next with respect to payments that are deferred compensation, in each case, beginning with payment s or beneﬁts that are to be paid the farthest in time from the determination of the Accounting Firm. All reasonable fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company . (c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder , it is possible that amounts shall have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive pursuant to this Agreement that shou ld not have been so paid or distributed (each, an “Overpayment ”) or that additional amounts that shall have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the beneﬁt of Executive pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed (each, an “Underpayment ”), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder .

Annual Bonus You will be eligible to receive a discretionary bonus on an annual basis with a target of 75% of your annual base salary, subject to both your and the Company’s performance. Your bonus payment amount will be based on your performance against the goals you align on with your manager and based on overall Company performance.

(i) Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company Group all “Confidential Information” and “Trade Secrets” as described in Section 8. The Company’s business has required and continues to require the expenditure of substantial amounts of money and the use of skills developed over a long period of time for research, marketing, sales, and development of its Confidential Information and Trade Secrets. As a result of these investments, the Company has developed and will continue to develop certain valuable Confidential Information and Trade Secrets that are particular, proprietary, and unique to the Company’s business, and the disclosure of which would cause the Company great and irreparable harm. Executive therefore acknowledges and agrees that it is fair and reasonable for the Company to take steps to protect itself from the risk of such disclosure, use, and/or misappropriation. 1116/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 11/46 (ii) During Executive’s employment and for a period of two (2) years following the termination of Executive’s employment for any reason, Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company or BHI or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, use, communicate, or divulge Confidential Information other than as necessary to perform Executive’s duties for the Company; provided, however, that if the Confidential Information is deemed a trade secret under Georgia law, then the period for nondisclosure shall continue for the applicable period under Georgia Trade Secret laws in effect at the time of Executive’s termination. In addition, except as necessary to perform Executive’s duties for the Company, during Executive’s employment and thereafter for the applicable period under the Georgia Trade Secret laws in effect at the time of Executive’s termination, Executive will not, directly or indirectly, transmit or disclose any Trade Secrets to any person or entity, and will not, directly or indirectly, make use of any Trade Secrets, for Executive or any other person or entity, without the express written consent of the Company. This provision will apply for so long as a particular Trade Secret retains its status as a trade secret under applicable law. The protection afforded to Trade Secrets and/or Confidential Information by this Agreement is not intended by the parties hereto to limit, and is intended to be in addition to, any protection provided to any such information under any applicable federal, state or local law. Pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive understands that: (i) an individual may not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that: (a) is made (1) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (2) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (b) is made in a complaint or other document that is filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding; and (ii) further, an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the employer’s trade secrets to the attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding if the individual: (a) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (b) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. 1216/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 12/46 (iii) All files, records, documents, drawings, specifications, data, computer programs, customer or vendor lists, specific customer or vendor information, marketing techniques, business strategies, contract terms, pricing terms, discounts and management compensation of the Company, BHI or any of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, whether prepared by Executive in the course of Executive’s duties or otherwise coming into Executive’s possession, shall remain the exclusive property of the Company, BHI or any of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, and Executive shall not remove any such items from the premises of the Company, BHI or any of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, except in furtherance of Executive’s duties. (iv) As requested by the Company from time to time and upon the termination of Executive’s employment with the Company for any reason, Executive will promptly deliver to the Company, BHI or any of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, all copies and embodiments, in whatever form, of all property of the Company, BHI or any of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates in Executive’s possession or within Executive’s control (including, but not limited to, Confidential Information, Trade Secrets, memoranda, records, notes, plans, photographs, manuals, notebooks, documentation, program listings, flow charts, magnetic media, disks, diskettes, tapes, keys, access cards, and credit cards) irrespective of the location or form of such material, including such information located on Executive’s personal mobile phone, tablet, or laptop computer. If requested by the Company, Executive will provide the Company with written confirmation that all such materials have been delivered to the Company as provided herein. (v) This Section 7(a) is not intended to restrict or limit any of the protected rights contained in this Agreement in any way. 1316/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 13/46 (b) Non-Solicitation of Protected Customers. Executive understands and agrees that the relationship between the Company Group and each of its Protected Customers constitutes a valuable asset of the Company Group and may not be converted to Executive’s own use. Executive hereby agrees that, during Executive’s employment with the Company and for a period of two (2) years following the termination of Executive’s employment for any reason, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, on Executive’s own behalf or as a Principal or Representative of any other Person, solicit, divert, take away, or attempt to solicit, divert, or take away a Protected Customer for the purpose of marketing, selling or providing to the Protected Customer any goods or services substantially similar to the goods or services provided by the Company Group during the two (2) years prior to the Date of Termination. (c) Non-Solicitation of Employees. Executive understands and agrees that the relationship between the Company Group any employee of the Company Group constitutes a valuable asset of the Company Group and may not be converted to Executive’s own use. Executive hereby agrees that, during Executive’s employment and for a period of two (2) years following the termination of Executive’s employment for any reason, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, on Executive’s own behalf or as a Principal or Representative of any other Person, solicit or induce, or attempt to solicit or induce, any employee of the Company Group to terminate their employment with the Company Group or, for a period of no more than six (6) months after the Company Group employee is no longer employed by any member of the Company Group, to enter into employment with any other Person that is in competition with the Company Group. (d) Non-Solicitation of Vendors. Executive understands and agrees that the relationship between the Company Group and each of its vendors constitutes a valuable asset of the Company Group and may not be converted to Executive’s own use. Executive hereby agrees that, during Executive’s employment with the Company and for a period of two (2) years following the termination of Executive’s employment for any reason, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, on Executive’s own behalf or as a Principal or Representative of any other Person, solicit, divert, take away, or attempt to solicit, divert, or take away or induce, any existing or prospective vendor of any member of the Company Group to reduce, terminate or otherwise negatively alter its relationship with any member of the Company Group. 1416/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 14/46 (e) Non-Competition. During Executive’s employment and, if Executive’s employment relationship is terminated for any reason hereunder, for a period of two (2) years following the termination of Executive’s employment (the “Restricted Period”), Executive shall not render executive services of the type provided by Executive to or on behalf of the Company within the two (2) years prior to the Date of Termination to any Person that engages in or owns, invests in any material respect, operates, manages or controls any venture or enterprise which substantially engages or proposes to substantially engage in the Competitive Services in the Restricted Territory. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the ownership by Executive of not more than five percent (5%) of any class of securities of any corporation having a class of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. (f) Ownership of Work Product. (i) The Company shall own all Work Product (as defined below). If any of the Work Product may not, by operation of law, be considered work made for hire by Executive for the Company, Executive agrees to assign, and upon creation thereof automatically assign, without further consideration, the ownership of all Confidential Information, Work Product and other intellectual property rights therein to the Company, its successors and assigns. The Company shall have the right to obtain and hold in its or their own name copyrights, registrations, patents, and any other protection available in the foregoing. Executive agrees to perform, upon the reasonable request of the Company, during or after Executive’s termination of employment with the Company, such further acts as may be necessary or desirable to transfer, perfect and defend the Company’s ownership of the Work Product. The Company shall reimburse all reasonable out-of- pocket expenses incurred by Executive at the Company’s request in connection with the foregoing. Executive hereby irrevocably relinquishes and waives for the benefit of the Company Group and its assigns any moral rights and any other nonassignable rights or claims in the Work Product recognized by applicable law. To the extent any of Executive’s rights in the Work Product are not assignable or waiveable, Executive hereby grants the Company a perpetual, irrevocable, exclusive license to use and exercise such rights in any manner whatsoever. 1516/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 15/46 (ii) For purposes hereof, “Work Product” means all intellectual property rights, including all U.S. and international copyrights, patentable inventions, Trade Secrets, discoveries and improvements, and other intellectual property rights, in any programming, documentation, technology, strategic plans, information, ideas, concepts or other work product (i) that relates to the business and interests of the Company Group and that Executive creates, invents, conceives or develops at any time during the term of Executive’s employment (whether or not during normal working hours), and for a period of 180 days thereafter, (ii) that relate to the Company Group’s business, actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the Company Group, or which results from any work performed by Executive (alone or in conjunction with others) for the Company Group or (iii) that is now contained in any of the technologies, products or systems of the Company Group to the extent Executive invented, created, conceived, developed or delivered such Work Product to the Company Group prior to the date of this Agreement while Executive was engaged as an employee of the Company Group or its predecessors in interest. (g) Reasonableness of Restrictions. Executive acknowledges that the postemployment restrictions contained in this Agreement are reasonable, proper, and necessitated by the Company’s legitimate business interests, and the goodwill associated with the Company’s business. Executive also acknowledges that the geographic scope of this Agreement is reasonable, necessary to protect the Company’s legitimate business interests, and does not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill and other legitimate business interests of the Company. Executive therefore acknowledges that the Company has a protectable interest in restricting Executive from disclosing Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, from competing against the Company, and from soliciting its Protected Customers and other employees. However, if, at the time of enforcement, a court or arbitrator holds that the duration, geographical area, or scope of activity restrictions stated in the Non-Competition and/or Non- Solicitation Sections of this Agreement are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, or impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill and other business interests of the Company, Executive agrees that the maximum duration, scope, or area reasonable under such circumstances will be substituted for the stated duration, scope, or area and that the court or arbitrator will be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum duration, scope, and area permitted by law, in all cases, giving effect to the intent of the parties that the restrictions contained herein be given effect to the broadest extent possible. 1616/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 16/46 (h) Remedies: Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge and agree that Executive’s breach of any of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7 will result in irreparable and continuing damage to the Company Group for which there may be no adequate remedy at law. The parties further agree and acknowledge that the Company, and each member of the Company Group, as applicable, shall be entitled to equitable relief, including specific performance and injunctive relief, as a remedy for any such breach and shall not be required to post bond in connection with obtaining such relief. Such equitable remedies shall be in addition to any and all remedies, including damages, available to the Company, or any member of the Company Group, as applicable, for such breaches by Executive. In addition, without limiting any of the foregoing remedies, and except as otherwise required by law, Executive shall not be entitled to any payments set forth in Section 6 hereof and shall be obligated to repay to the Company the after tax amount of any payments previously made pursuant to Section 6 hereof if Executive commits a Material Breach of any of the covenants set forth in this Section 7 and fails to remedy or cure such Material Breach within fifteen (15) business days after Executive’s receipt of written notice thereof from the Company. (i) Communication of Section 7 Obligations. During Executive’s employment and for two years thereafter. Executive will communicate Executive’s obligations under this Section 7 to any person, firm, association, partnership, corporation or other entity with which Executive accepts employment or is considering an offer of employment. 1716/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 17/46 (j) No Harassing or Disparaging Conduct. Executive further agrees and promises that Executive will not engage in, or induce other persons to engage in, any harassing or disparaging conduct or negative or derogatory statements directed at or about Company, the activities of Company, or the Releasees at any time in the future. For purposes of this Section, a disparaging statement is any communication, oral or written, which would tend to cause the recipient of the communication to question the business condition, integrity, competence, fairness, or good character of the person to whom, or the entity to which, the communication relates. Executive understands that this nondisparagement provision does not apply on occasions when Executive testifies or gives evidence to a court or other governmental authority and Executive must, of course, respond truthfully, to conduct otherwise protected by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or to conduct or testimony in the context of enforcing the terms of this Agreement or other rights, powers, privileges, or claims not released by this Agreement. Nothing in this nondisparagement provision is intended in any way to intimidate, coerce, deter, persuade, or compensate Executive with respect to providing, withholding, or restricting any communication whatsoever to the extent prohibited under 18 U.S.C. §§ 201, 1503, or 1512 or under any similar or related provision of state or federal law. The Company agrees to instruct the executive officers of Company not to engage in or induce other persons to engage in, any harassing or disparaging conduct or negative or derogatory statements directed at or about Executive at any time in the future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company will not be liable for any unauthorized statements made by any officer or employee of Company, and nothing in this Section may be used to penalize Company for any officer or employee providing truthful testimony under oath in a judicial or administrative proceeding or complying with an order of a court or governmental agency of competent jurisdiction. (k) No Limitation. The Company’s rights under this Section 7 are in addition to, and not in lieu of, all other rights the Company may have at law or in equity to protect its confidential information, trade secrets and other proprietary interests. 1816/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 18/46 (l) Protected Rights. Executive understands that nothing contained in this Agreement limits Executive’s ability to file a charge or complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (“Government Agencies”). Executive further understands that this Agreement does not limit Executive’s ability to communicate with any Government Agencies or otherwise participate in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any Government Agencies, nor does this Agreement impact or limit Executive’s eligibility to receive an award for information provided to any Government Agencies. 8.

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8(a) to the contrary, in the event the Company is precluded from providing the Cause Notice due to applicable law or regulation, or an ongoing internal investigation that would be compromised by providing the Cause Notice, the Company shall provide the Cause Notice within ten (10) business days after such impediment to providing the Cause Notice no longer exists.

In no event shall the reimbursements or in-kind benefits to be provided by the Company in one taxable year affect the amount of reimbursements or in-kind benefits to be provided in any other taxable year, nor shall Executive’s right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. (c) Each payment under this Agreement shall be considered a “separate payment” and not of a series of payments for purposes of Section 409A. (d) Any Delayed Payments shall bear interest at the United States 5-year Treasury Rate plus 2%, which accumulated interest shall be paid to Executive on the Permissible Payment Date. 12. Excess Parachute Payments. (a) In the event that it shall be determined, based upon the advice of the independent public accountants for BHI or the Company (the “Accountants”), that any payment, benefit or distribution by the Company, BHI or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates (a “Payment”) constitute “parachute payments” under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, as amended, then, if the aggregate present value of all such Payments (collectively, the “Parachute Amount”) exceeds 2.99 times Executive’s “base amount”, as defined in Section 280G(h)(3) of the Code (the “Executive Base Amount”), the amounts constituting “parachute payments” which would otherwise be payable to or for the benefit of Executive shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that the Parachute Amount is equal to 2.99 times Executive Base Amount (the “Reduced Amount”); provided that such amounts shall not be so reduced if Executive determines, based upon the advice of the Accountants, that without such reduction Executive would be entitled to receive and retain, on a net after tax basis (including, without limitation, any excise taxes payable under Section 4999 of the Code), an amount which is greater than the amount, on a net after tax basis, that Executive would be entitled to retain upon Executive’s receipt of the Reduced Amount. 2916/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 29/46 (b) If the determination made pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 12 results in a reduction of the payments that would otherwise be paid to Executive except for the application of clause (a) of this Section 12, each particular entitlement of Executive shall be eliminated or reduced as follows: (i) first all cash payments, pro rata; and then (ii) all remaining benefits, pro rata. Within any of these categories, a reduction shall occur first with respect to amounts that are not deemed to constitute a “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of Code Section 409A (“Nonqualified Deferred Compensation”) and then with respect to amounts that are treated as Nonqualified Deferred Compensation, with such reduction being applied in each case to the payments in the reverse order in which they would otherwise be made, that is, later payments shall be reduced before earlier payments. (c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 280G of the Code at the time of a determination hereunder, it is possible that payments will be made by the Company which should not have been made under clause (a) of this Section 12 (‘‘Overpayment”) or that additional payments which are not made by the Company pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 12 should have been made (“Underpayment”). In the event that there is a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service, or a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction, that an Overpayment has been made and that repayment will eliminate any excise tax otherwise due under Section 4999 of the Code, any such Overpayment shall be repaid by Executive to the Company together with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code. In the event that there is a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service, a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in the provisions of the Code or regulations pursuant to which an Underpayment arises, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive, together with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code. 3016/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 30/46 13. Cancelation of Prior Agreements. Executive’s employment is currently governed by a May 3, 2017 Employment Agreement, as amended, (the “SVP Employment Agreement”), a September 29, 2022 Transition Agreement (the “Transition Agreement”), and a December 23, 2022 Amended Transition Agreement (“Amended Transition Agreement”). This Agreement expressly cancels and supersedes the SVP Employment Agreement, Transition Agreement, and the Amended Transition Agreement except this Agreement does not in any way affect, modify, or nullify any prior agreement Executive has entered into with the Company regarding arbitration, confidentiality, trade secrets, inventions, unfair competition, or prior restrictive covenant agreements. To the extent any surviving agreement regarding arbitration, confidentiality, trade secrets, inventions, unfair competition, or restrictive covenants is inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, this Agreement shall control. For the avoidance of doubt, Executive acknowledges and agrees that he is waiving all rights and entitlements to all unpaid or future payments and benefits contemplated by the Amended Transition Agreement, including those described in Section 4 therein. Additionally, Executive agrees to refund to the Company the gross amounts of any previous payments he received pursuant to Sections 4(a)(i) and 4(a)(iv) of the Amended Transition Agreement. 14. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement is to bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive, the Company and their respective heirs, executors, personal representatives, successors and assigns, except that neither party may assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party. Executive hereby consents to the assignment by the Company of all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any successor to the Company by merger or consolidation or purchase of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, provided that the transferee or successor assumes the Company’s liabilities under this Agreement by agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Executive. 3116/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 31/46 15. Survival. Subject to any limits on applicability contained therein, Section 7 will survive and continue in full force in accordance with its terms notwithstanding any termination of the Employment Period. 16. Indemnity. If any action is brought against the Company involving: (1) any actual or alleged restrictive covenant or other agreement that may prohibit or restrict Executive’s employment by the Company, or (2) Executive’s actual or alleged misappropriation of Confidential Information or Trade Secret, Executive agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold the Company harmless from any and all costs incurred in defending such proceeding. This includes, but is not limited to, court fees, attorneys’ fees, and from any and all liability, judgment, or settlement assessed against the Company. 17. Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the law of the State of Georgia, and the Parties agree that any actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement or Executive’s employment with Company must be brought exclusively in either the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, or the State or Superior Courts of Cobb County, Georgia. Notwithstanding the pendency of any proceeding, either Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief in a state or federal court located in Cobb County, Georgia upon a showing of irreparable injury. The Parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue solely within these forums and solely in Cobb County, Georgia and waive all otherwise possible objections thereto. 18. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement is to be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, that invalidity, illegality or unenforceability is not to affect any other provision or any other jurisdiction, and this Agreement is to be reformed, construed and enforced in the jurisdiction as if the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. 3216/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 32/46 19.

Executive further agrees and covenants that this Release is a bar to any claim, action, suit, or proceeding pertaining to the Released Claims. In the event Executive breaches the covenant contained in this Section 7, Executive agrees to indemnify the Releasees for all damages and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by any Releasees in defending, participating in or investigating any matter or proceeding covered by this Section 7. This provision does not prohibit Executive from filing a lawsuit challenging the validity of Executive’s waiver of claims under the ADEA. 8. Damages for Breach.

However, in the event any such ADEA lawsuit is unsuccessful, a court may order Executive to pay attorney’s fees and/or costs incurred by Releasees (or any of them) where authorized by law. In the event any such ADEA lawsuit is successful, the severance benefits or payment Executive received for signing this Separation and Release Agreement shall serve as restitution, recoupment, or setoff to any monetary award received by Executive. 16/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 40/46 9.

By signing this Separation and Release Agreement, Executive does not release the right to file any claims that are not permitted to be waived or released under applicable law or regulation, or the right to communicate with an attorney. Executive further understands that this Separation and Release Agreement does not limit Executive’s ability to communicate with any Government Agencies or otherwise participate in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any Government Agency including providing documents or other information, without notice to Company. 16/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 41/46 11.

The Company specifically denies any liability for wrongdoing. 14. Governing Law.

Executive agrees that the period of coverage under such plans (or the period of reimbursement if participation is through COBRA) shall count against the plans’ obligation to provide continuation coverage pursuant to COBRA; and (v) to the extent not theretofore paid or provided, any other amounts or benefits required to be paid or provided or which Executive is eligible to receive under any plan, program, policy or practice or contract or agreement of the Company (such other amounts and benefits shall be hereinafter referred to as the “Other Benefits”). 916/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 9/46 (d) If Executive’s employment is terminated on account of a Change in Control Termination, subject to Section 6(e) below, Executive shall be entitled to the payments and benefits described in Section 6(c), contingent upon Executive’s execution of the Separation and Release Agreement, attached as Exhibit A, except that: (i) the payment called for in Section 6(c)(i) shall be equal to two (2) times the sum of Executive’s annual Base Salary plus Executive’s target annual bonus in effect immediately prior to the Date of Termination instead of two (2) times Executive’s Base Salary, less applicable payroll deductions; (ii) all unvested performance-vested performance share unit or restricted stock unit grants shall be deemed satisfied at the greater of target or actual performance extrapolated as of the Change in Control Termination through the end of the applicable performance period, provided that actual performance may only be extrapolated as of the Change in Control Termination if at least one year of the grant’s performance period has been completed as of the Change in Control Termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the unvested units are subject to a stock price performance condition that is not satisfied at the closing of the Change in Control, such units shall not vest and shall be forfeited by Executive. (iii) the time period described in Section 6(c)(iv) shall be eighteen (18) months instead of one (1) year. 1016/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 10/46 (e) The Company shall have no obligation to make any of the payments, or deliver any of the benefits, in accordance with Section 6(c) or Section 6(d) if Executive declines to sign and return the Separation and Release Agreement, or revokes the Separation and Release Agreement or the Separation and Release Agreement does not become effective within the sixty (60) calendar day period after the Date of Termination. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any payments to be made, or benefits to be delivered, under this Agreement (other than the payments required to be made by the Company pursuant to Sections 6(a) prior to Executive’s execution of the Separation and Release Agreement and the expiration of the applicable revocation period, without Executive having elected to revoke same, within the 60-day period after the Date of Termination, shall be accumulated and paid in a lump sum or delivered after Executive’s execution of the Separation and Release Agreement and the expiration of the applicable revocation period, without Executive having elected to revoke same (except that, if such 60-day period spans more than one (1) calendar year, and the payments or benefits constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, the payments shall be paid, and the benefits delivered, in the subsequent calendar year). (f) Executive is not required to mitigate the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise. 7. Competitive Activity; Confidentiality; Non-solicitation; Ownership of Work Product. (a) Confidential Information and Trade Secrets. (i) Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company Group all “Confidential Information” and “Trade Secrets” as described in Section 8. The Company’s business has required and continues to require the expenditure of substantial amounts of money and the use of skills developed over a long period of time for research, marketing, sales, and development of its Confidential Information and Trade Secrets. As a result of these investments, the Company has developed and will continue to develop certain valuable Confidential Information and Trade Secrets that are particular, proprietary, and unique to the Company’s business, and the disclosure of which would cause the Company great and irreparable harm. Executive therefore acknowledges and agrees that it is fair and reasonable for the Company to take steps to protect itself from the risk of such disclosure, use, and/or misappropriation. 1116/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 11/46 (ii) During Executive’s employment and for a period of two (2) years following the termination of Executive’s employment for any reason, Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company or BHI or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, use, communicate, or divulge Confidential Information other than as necessary to perform Executive’s duties for the Company; provided, however, that if the Confidential Information is deemed a trade secret under Georgia law, then the period for nondisclosure shall continue for the applicable period under Georgia Trade Secret laws in effect at the time of Executive’s termination. In addition, except as necessary to perform Executive’s duties for the Company, during Executive’s employment and thereafter for the applicable period under the Georgia Trade Secret laws in effect at the time of Executive’s termination, Executive will not, directly or indirectly, transmit or disclose any Trade Secrets to any person or entity, and will not, directly or indirectly, make use of any Trade Secrets, for Executive or any other person or entity, without the express written consent of the Company. This provision will apply for so long as a particular Trade Secret retains its status as a trade secret under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the ownership by Executive of not more than five percent (5%) of any class of securities of any corporation having a class of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. (f) Ownership of Work Product. (i) The Company shall own all Work Product (as defined below). If any of the Work Product may not, by operation of law, be considered work made for hire by Executive for the Company, Executive agrees to assign, and upon creation thereof automatically assign, without further consideration, the ownership of all Confidential Information, Work Product and other intellectual property rights therein to the Company, its successors and assigns. The Company shall have the right to obtain and hold in its or their own name copyrights, registrations, patents, and any other protection available in the foregoing.

Executive hereby irrevocably relinquishes and waives for the benefit of the Company Group and its assigns any moral rights and any other nonassignable rights or claims in the Work Product recognized by applicable law. To the extent any of Executive’s rights in the Work Product are not assignable or waiveable, Executive hereby grants the Company a perpetual, irrevocable, exclusive license to use and exercise such rights in any manner whatsoever. 1516/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 15/46 (ii) For purposes hereof, “Work Product” means all intellectual property rights, including all U.S. and international copyrights, patentable inventions, Trade Secrets, discoveries and improvements, and other intellectual property rights, in any programming, documentation, technology, strategic plans, information, ideas, concepts or other work product (i) that relates to the business and interests of the Company Group and that Executive creates, invents, conceives or develops at any time during the term of Executive’s employment (whether or not during normal working hours), and for a period of 180 days thereafter, (ii) that relate to the Company Group’s business, actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the Company Group, or which results from any work performed by Executive (alone or in conjunction with others) for the Company Group or (iii) that is now contained in any of the technologies, products or systems of the Company Group to the extent Executive invented, created, conceived, developed or delivered such Work Product to the Company Group prior to the date of this Agreement while Executive was engaged as an employee of the Company Group or its predecessors in interest. (g) Reasonableness of Restrictions. Executive acknowledges that the postemployment restrictions contained in this Agreement are reasonable, proper, and necessitated by the Company’s legitimate business interests, and the goodwill associated with the Company’s business. Executive also acknowledges that the geographic scope of this Agreement is reasonable, necessary to protect the Company’s legitimate business interests, and does not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill and other legitimate business interests of the Company. Executive therefore acknowledges that the Company has a protectable interest in restricting Executive from disclosing Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, from competing against the Company, and from soliciting its Protected Customers and other employees. However, if, at the time of enforcement, a court or arbitrator holds that the duration, geographical area, or scope of activity restrictions stated in the Non-Competition and/or Non- Solicitation Sections of this Agreement are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, or impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill and other business interests of the Company, Executive agrees that the maximum duration, scope, or area reasonable under such circumstances will be substituted for the stated duration, scope, or area and that the court or arbitrator will be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum duration, scope, and area permitted by law, in all cases, giving effect to the intent of the parties that the restrictions contained herein be given effect to the broadest extent possible. 1616/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 16/46 (h) Remedies: Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge and agree that Executive’s breach of any of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7 will result in irreparable and continuing damage to the Company Group for which there may be no adequate remedy at law. The parties further agree and acknowledge that the Company, and each member of the Company Group, as applicable, shall be entitled to equitable relief, including specific performance and injunctive relief, as a remedy for any such breach and shall not be required to post bond in connection with obtaining such relief. Such equitable remedies shall be in addition to any and all remedies, including damages, available to the Company, or any member of the Company Group, as applicable, for such breaches by Executive. In addition, without limiting any of the foregoing remedies, and except as otherwise required by law, Executive shall not be entitled to any payments set forth in Section 6 hereof and shall be obligated to repay to the Company the after tax amount of any payments previously made pursuant to Section 6 hereof if Executive commits a Material Breach of any of the covenants set forth in this Section 7 and fails to remedy or cure such Material Breach within fifteen (15) business days after Executive’s receipt of written notice thereof from the Company. (i) Communication of Section 7 Obligations. During Executive’s employment and for two years thereafter. Executive will communicate Executive’s obligations under this Section 7 to any person, firm, association, partnership, corporation or other entity with which Executive accepts employment or is considering an offer of employment. 1716/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 17/46 (j) No Harassing or Disparaging Conduct. Executive further agrees and promises that Executive will not engage in, or induce other persons to engage in, any harassing or disparaging conduct or negative or derogatory statements directed at or about Company, the activities of Company, or the Releasees at any time in the future. For purposes of this Section, a disparaging statement is any communication, oral or written, which would tend to cause the recipient of the communication to question the business condition, integrity, competence, fairness, or good character of the person to whom, or the entity to which, the communication relates. Executive understands that this nondisparagement provision does not apply on occasions when Executive testifies or gives evidence to a court or other governmental authority and Executive must, of course, respond truthfully, to conduct otherwise protected by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or to conduct or testimony in the context of enforcing the terms of this Agreement or other rights, powers, privileges, or claims not released by this Agreement. Nothing in this nondisparagement provision is intended in any way to intimidate, coerce, deter, persuade, or compensate Executive with respect to providing, withholding, or restricting any communication whatsoever to the extent prohibited under 18 U.S.C. §§ 201, 1503, or 1512 or under any similar or related provision of state or federal law. The Company agrees to instruct the executive officers of Company not to engage in or induce other persons to engage in, any harassing or disparaging conduct or negative or derogatory statements directed at or about Executive at any time in the future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company will not be liable for any unauthorized statements made by any officer or employee of Company, and nothing in this Section may be used to penalize Company for any officer or employee providing truthful testimony under oath in a judicial or administrative proceeding or complying with an order of a court or governmental agency of competent jurisdiction. (k) No Limitation. The Company’s rights under this Section 7 are in addition to, and not in lieu of, all other rights the Company may have at law or in equity to protect its confidential information, trade secrets and other proprietary interests. 1816/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 18/46 (l) Protected Rights. Executive understands that nothing contained in this Agreement limits Executive’s ability to file a charge or complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (“Government Agencies”). Executive further understands that this Agreement does not limit Executive’s ability to communicate with any Government Agencies or otherwise participate in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any Government Agencies, nor does this Agreement impact or limit Executive’s eligibility to receive an award for information provided to any Government Agencies. 8.

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8(a) to the contrary, in the event the Company is precluded from providing the Cause Notice due to applicable law or regulation, or an ongoing internal investigation that would be compromised by providing the Cause Notice, the Company shall provide the Cause Notice within ten (10) business days after such impediment to providing the Cause Notice no longer exists.

Withholding of Taxes. The Company shall withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city or other taxes that the Company is required to withhold under any applicable law, regulation or ruling. 11. Section 409A. (a) Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, if Executive is a “specified employee” (within the meaning of Section 409A and determined pursuant to procedures adopted by the Company) at the time of Executive’s separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A) and if any portion of the payments or benefits to be received by Executive upon separation from service would be considered deferred compensation under Section 409A (that does not qualify for an exemption from Section 409A), any such deferred compensation amounts that would otherwise be payable pursuant to this Agreement during the six-month period immediately following Executive’s separation from service (the “Delayed Payments”) and any such benefits that would be deferred compensation and that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Agreement (the “Delayed Benefits”) during the six-month period immediately following Executive’s separation from service (such period, the “Delay Period”) shall instead be paid or made available on the earlier of (i) the first business day following the six-month anniversary of the date of Executive’s separation from service or (ii) Executive’s death (the applicable date, the “Permissible Payment Date”). 2816/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 28/46 (b) With respect to any amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement under Section 6(a), such expenses shall be reimbursed by the Company within thirty (30) calendar days following the date on which the Company receives the applicable invoice from Executive but in no event later than December 31 of the year following the year in which Executive incurs the related expenses; provided, that with respect to reimbursement relating to the Additional Delayed Payments, such reimbursement shall be made on the Permissible Payment Date. In no event shall the reimbursements or in-kind benefits to be provided by the Company in one taxable year affect the amount of reimbursements or in-kind benefits to be provided in any other taxable year, nor shall Executive’s right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. (c) Each payment under this Agreement shall be considered a “separate payment” and not of a series of payments for purposes of Section 409A. (d) Any Delayed Payments shall bear interest at the United States 5-year Treasury Rate plus 2%, which accumulated interest shall be paid to Executive on the Permissible Payment Date. 12. Excess Parachute Payments. (a) In the event that it shall be determined, based upon the advice of the independent public accountants for BHI or the Company (the “Accountants”), that any payment, benefit or distribution by the Company, BHI or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates (a “Payment”) constitute “parachute payments” under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, as amended, then, if the aggregate present value of all such Payments (collectively, the “Parachute Amount”) exceeds 2.99 times Executive’s “base amount”, as defined in Section 280G(h)(3) of the Code (the “Executive Base Amount”), the amounts constituting “parachute payments” which would otherwise be payable to or for the benefit of Executive shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that the Parachute Amount is equal to 2.99 times Executive Base Amount (the “Reduced Amount”); provided that such amounts shall not be so reduced if Executive determines, based upon the advice of the Accountants, that without such reduction Executive would be entitled to receive and retain, on a net after tax basis (including, without limitation, any excise taxes payable under Section 4999 of the Code), an amount which is greater than the amount, on a net after tax basis, that Executive would be entitled to retain upon Executive’s receipt of the Reduced Amount. 2916/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 29/46 (b) If the determination made pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 12 results in a reduction of the payments that would otherwise be paid to Executive except for the application of clause (a) of this Section 12, each particular entitlement of Executive shall be eliminated or reduced as follows: (i) first all cash payments, pro rata; and then (ii) all remaining benefits, pro rata. Within any of these categories, a reduction shall occur first with respect to amounts that are not deemed to constitute a “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of Code Section 409A (“Nonqualified Deferred Compensation”) and then with respect to amounts that are treated as Nonqualified Deferred Compensation, with such reduction being applied in each case to the payments in the reverse order in which they would otherwise be made, that is, later payments shall be reduced before earlier payments. (c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 280G of the Code at the time of a determination hereunder, it is possible that payments will be made by the Company which should not have been made under clause (a) of this Section 12 (‘‘Overpayment”) or that additional payments which are not made by the Company pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 12 should have been made (“Underpayment”). In the event that there is a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service, or a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction, that an Overpayment has been made and that repayment will eliminate any excise tax otherwise due under Section 4999 of the Code, any such Overpayment shall be repaid by Executive to the Company together with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code. In the event that there is a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service, a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in the provisions of the Code or regulations pursuant to which an Underpayment arises, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive, together with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code. 3016/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 30/46 13. Cancelation of Prior Agreements. Executive’s employment is currently governed by a May 3, 2017 Employment Agreement, as amended, (the “SVP Employment Agreement”), a September 29, 2022 Transition Agreement (the “Transition Agreement”), and a December 23, 2022 Amended Transition Agreement (“Amended Transition Agreement”). This Agreement expressly cancels and supersedes the SVP Employment Agreement, Transition Agreement, and the Amended Transition Agreement except this Agreement does not in any way affect, modify, or nullify any prior agreement Executive has entered into with the Company regarding arbitration, confidentiality, trade secrets, inventions, unfair competition, or prior restrictive covenant agreements. To the extent any surviving agreement regarding arbitration, confidentiality, trade secrets, inventions, unfair competition, or restrictive covenants is inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, this Agreement shall control. For the avoidance of doubt, Executive acknowledges and agrees that he is waiving all rights and entitlements to all unpaid or future payments and benefits contemplated by the Amended Transition Agreement, including those described in Section 4 therein. Additionally, Executive agrees to refund to the Company the gross amounts of any previous payments he received pursuant to Sections 4(a)(i) and 4(a)(iv) of the Amended Transition Agreement. 14. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement is to bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive, the Company and their respective heirs, executors, personal representatives, successors and assigns, except that neither party may assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party. Executive hereby consents to the assignment by the Company of all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any successor to the Company by merger or consolidation or purchase of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, provided that the transferee or successor assumes the Company’s liabilities under this Agreement by agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Executive. 3116/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 31/46 15. Survival. Subject to any limits on applicability contained therein, Section 7 will survive and continue in full force in accordance with its terms notwithstanding any termination of the Employment Period. 16. Indemnity. If any action is brought against the Company involving: (1) any actual or alleged restrictive covenant or other agreement that may prohibit or restrict Executive’s employment by the Company, or (2) Executive’s actual or alleged misappropriation of Confidential Information or Trade Secret, Executive agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold the Company harmless from any and all costs incurred in defending such proceeding. This includes, but is not limited to, court fees, attorneys’ fees, and from any and all liability, judgment, or settlement assessed against the Company. 17. Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the law of the State of Georgia, and the Parties agree that any actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement or Executive’s employment with Company must be brought exclusively in either the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, or the State or Superior Courts of Cobb County, Georgia. Notwithstanding the pendency of any proceeding, either Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief in a state or federal court located in Cobb County, Georgia upon a showing of irreparable injury. The Parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue solely within these forums and solely in Cobb County, Georgia and waive all otherwise possible objections thereto. 18. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement is to be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, that invalidity, illegality or unenforceability is not to affect any other provision or any other jurisdiction, and this Agreement is to be reformed, construed and enforced in the jurisdiction as if the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. 3216/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 32/46 19.

Any notice under this Agreement is to be deemed to have been given when so delivered, sent or mailed. 20. Amendment and Waiver. The provisions of this Agreement may be amended or waived only with the prior written consent of the Company and Executive, and no course of conduct or failure or delay in enforcing the provisions of this Agreement is to affect the validity, binding effect or enforceability of this Agreement. 21. Complete Agreement.

Time to Consider. a. The Released Claims include any claims Executive may have against any of the Releasees under the ADEA (the “ADEA Release”). Executive understands that Executive has been given twenty-one (21) calendar days to consider this Agreement and agrees that this consideration period has been reasonable and adequate (the “Consideration Period”). If Executive decides to sign this Agreement before the expiration of the Consideration Period, which is solely Executive’s choice, Executive represents that Executive’s decision is knowing and voluntary. Executive agrees that any revisions made to this Agreement after it was initially delivered to Executive, whether material or immaterial, do not restart the Consideration Period.

If Executive chooses to revoke the ADEA Release, Executive must notify the Company in writing addressed to the Company’s designated agent for this purpose: [Name] [Position] BlueLinx Corporation 1950 Spectrum Circle Suite 300 Marietta, Georgia 30067 16/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 39/46 Any such notice of revocation must be delivered to the Company at the foregoing address in a manner calculated to ensure receipt prior to 11:59 p.m. on the day prior to the ADEA Release Date. The Parties agree the ADEA Release Installment has been allocated to the ADEA Release. If Executive revokes the ADEA Release, Executive will not be entitled to the ADEA Release Installment. The remainder of the Consideration not allocated to the ADEA Release Installment will act as consideration for the remaining Released Claims, promises, and covenants in this Agreement, which the Parties agree and acknowledge became binding and effective as of the Effective Date and survive if Executive revokes the ADEA Release. 7. Covenant Not to Sue. Subject to Section 10 and unless prohibited by applicable law, Executive agrees and covenants not to sue or initiate any claims in any forum against any of the Releasees on account of or in relation to any Released Claim, or to incite, assist or encourage other persons or entities to bring claims of any nature whatsoever against Company or Releasees. Executive further agrees and covenants that this Release is a bar to any claim, action, suit, or proceeding pertaining to the Released Claims. In the event Executive breaches the covenant contained in this Section 7, Executive agrees to indemnify the Releasees for all damages and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by any Releasees in defending, participating in or investigating any matter or proceeding covered by this Section 7. This provision does not prohibit Executive from filing a lawsuit challenging the validity of Executive’s waiver of claims under the ADEA. 8. Damages for Breach. If Executive breaches this Separation and Release Agreement, Executive shall pay all costs incurred by Releasees (or any of them), including reasonable attorney’s fees, in defending against Executive’s claim, and, as a precondition to filing any such lawsuit, shall return all but $500.00 of the severance benefits or payments Executive has received pursuant to Section 6(c) or Section 6(d) of the Employment Agreement. The preceding two sentences of this section do not apply if Executive files a charge or lawsuit under the ADEA challenging the validity of this Separation and Release Agreement. However, in the event any such ADEA lawsuit is unsuccessful, a court may order Executive to pay attorney’s fees and/or costs incurred by Releasees (or any of them) where authorized by law. In the event any such ADEA lawsuit is successful, the severance benefits or payment Executive received for signing this Separation and Release Agreement shall serve as restitution, recoupment, or setoff to any monetary award received by Executive. 16/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 40/46 9.

Protected Rights. Executive understands that nothing contained in this Separation and Release Agreement limits Executive’s ability to file a charge or complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (“Government Agencies”). By signing this Separation and Release Agreement, Executive does not release the right to file any claims that are not permitted to be waived or released under applicable law or regulation, or the right to communicate with an attorney. Executive further understands that this Separation and Release Agreement does not limit Executive’s ability to communicate with any Government Agencies or otherwise participate in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any Government Agency including providing documents or other information, without notice to Company. 16/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 41/46 11. Restrictive Covenant Reaffirmation. Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees that he continues to be bound by the restrictive covenants contained in the Employment Agreement, including all covenants and promises in Section 7 of the Employment Agreement, and that these covenants, pursuant to their terms, survive Executive’s separation of employment from the Company. 12. Non-Disparagement. Executive agrees not to make, publish or communicate to any person or entity or in any public forum (including social media) at any time any defamatory or disparaging statements concerning the Company, BHI, and their affiliates or shareholders, or any of their respective officers, directors, members, managers, employees, products or services. 13. Non-Admission. This Separation and Release Agreement will not be construed as an admission by the Company or the Releasees of any liability or wrongdoing to Executive, breach of any agreement, or violation of statute, law, or regulation, or a waiver of any defenses to those matters within the scope of this Separation and Release Agreement. The Company specifically denies any liability for wrongdoing. 14. Governing Law. This Separation and Release Agreement shall be governed by the law of the State of Georgia, and the Parties agree that any actions arising out of or relating to this Separation and Release Agreement or Executive’s employment with Company must be brought exclusively in either the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, or the State or Superior Courts of Cobb County, Georgia. Notwithstanding the pendency of any proceeding, either Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief in a state or federal court located in Cobb County, Georgia upon a showing of irreparable injury. The Parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue solely within these forums and solely in Cobb County, Georgia and waive all otherwise possible objections thereto. The existence of any claim or cause of action by Executive against Company, including any dispute relating to the termination of Executive’s employment or under this Separation and Release Agreement, shall not constitute a defense to enforcement of said covenants by injunction. 16/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 42/46 15. Severability. If any provision of this Separation and Release Agreement shall be held void, voidable, invalid, or inoperative, no other provision of this Separation and Release Agreement shall be affected as a result thereof, and accordingly, the remaining provisions of this Separation and Release Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as though such void, voidable, invalid or inoperative provision had not been contained herein. If any provision of this Separation and Release Agreement shall be held void, voidable, invalid, or inoperative, the Company may, however, at its sole option, void this Separation and Release Agreement, in which case Executive shall immediately return any consideration provided to Executive pursuant to Section 6(c) or Section 6(d) of the Employment Agreement. 16. Entire Agreement. This Separation and Release Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Executive and the Company with respect to the issues addressed in this Separation and Release Agreement, except this Separation and Release Agreement does not in any way affect, modify, or nullify any prior agreement Executive has entered into with the Company regarding arbitration, confidentiality, trade secrets, inventions, unfair competition, or prior restrictive covenant agreements. This Separation and Release Agreement may not be modified, altered, or discharged except in writing signed by Executive and an authorized Company representative. 17. Successors and Assigns. This Separation and Release Agreement and all covenants and agreements contained herein shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties, their respective heirs, successors, assigns and any persons or entities claiming by, through or under them. 16/04/2025, 06:28 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030243 43/46 18. Medicare, Medicaid, and the SCHIP Extension Act.

All of the Shares subject to the Plan Limit may be issued pursuant to Incentive Stock Options. 516/04/2025, 06:26 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 5/14(b) Rules Applicable to Determining Shares Available for Awards. The number of Shares available for Awards at any time will be reduced by the number of Shares subject to the outstanding Awards and, by the number of Shares actually delivered prior thereto upon settlement or payment of Awards. For purposes of determining the number of Shares actually so delivered, (i) the number of Shares that are tendered by a Participant or withheld by the Company to pay the exercise price of an Award or to satisfy the Participant’s tax withholding obligations in connection with the exercise or settlement of an Award and (ii) all of the Shares covered by a stock-settled Stock Appreciation Right to the extent exercised, will be deemed to have been actually delivered. Shares Awards that are forfeited or cancelled or otherwise expire for any reason without having been exercised or settled or that are settled through issuance of consideration other than Shares (including, without limitation, cash) shall again be available for the grant of Awards; provided, however, that this provision shall not be applicable with respect to (i) the cancellation of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Option upon the exercise of the Option or (ii) the cancellation of an Option granted in tandem with a Stock Appreciation Right upon the exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right. (c) Special Limits. Anything to the contrary in Section 6 (a) notwithstanding, but subject to adjustment under Section 14, the following special limits shall apply to Shares available for Awards: (i) the maximum number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to awards of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Stock, Performance Units and Other Awards that are payable in Shares granted under the Plan shall be ﬁve million (5,000,000) shares in the aggregate; and (ii) subject to the other limitations set forth herein, the maximum amount of Awards that may be awarded to any Participant in any ﬁscal year is 15% of the Shares measured as of the Effective Date provided however, that no Non-Employee Director may receive one or more Awards in any ﬁscal year in excess of 30,000 Shares. (d) Substitute Awards. Any Shares underlying Substitute Awards shall not be counted against the number of Shares issuable hereunder and shall not be subject to Section 6 (c). (e) Legal Compliance. Shares will not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Award will comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations as determined by counsel for the Company. 7. AWARDS IN GENERAL. (a) Types of Awards. Incentive Stock Options, Non-Qualiﬁed Stock Options, Stock Grants, Stock-Based Awards, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Stock Appreciation Rights, Performance Units, Performance Stock and other stock or cash awards may be granted as the Administrator may determine. Any Award described in Sections 8 through 12 may be granted singly or in combination or tandem with any other Award, as the Administrator may determine. Awards under the Plan may be made in combination with, in replacement of, or as alternatives to awards or rights under any other compensation or beneﬁt plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries, including the plan of any acquired entity. (b) Terms Set Forth in Award Document. The terms and conditions of each Award shall be set forth in an Award Document in a form and with terms and conditions approved by the Administrator, which Award Document shall contain terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Administrator may accelerate (i) the vesting or payment of any Award, (ii) the lapse of restrictions on any Award or (iii) the date on which any Award ﬁrst becomes exercisable. The terms of Awards may vary among Participants, and the Plan does not impose upon the Administrator any requirement to make Awards subject to uniform terms. (c) Termination of Employment. The Administrator shall specify at or after the time of grant of an Award the provisions governing the disposition of an Award in the event of a Participant’s termination of employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, in connection with a Participant’s termination of employment, the Administrator shall have the discretion to accelerate the vesting, exercisability or settlement of, eliminate the restrictions and conditions applicable to, or extend the post-termination exercise period of an outstanding Award. Such provisions may be speciﬁed in the applicable Award Document or determined at a subsequent time. 616/04/2025, 06:26 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 6/14(d) Change of Control. (i) The Administrator shall have full authority to determine the effect, if any, of a Change of Control (or similar events, as determined by the Administrator) on the vesting, exercisability, settlement, payment, lapse of restrictions or other terms and conditions applicable to an Award, which effect may be speciﬁed in the applicable Award Document or determined at a subsequent time. Subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Administrator may, at any time prior to, coincident with or after the effective time of a Change of Control, take such actions as it may consider necessary or desirable, including, without limitation: (A) providing for the acceleration of any vesting conditions relating to the exercise or settlement of an Award or that an Award shall terminate or expire unless exercised or settled in full on or before a date ﬁxed by the Administrator; (B) making such adjustments to an Awards to reﬂect such Change of Control; (C) causing Awards to be assumed, or new rights to be substituted therefor, by the surviving corporation or other entity in such Change of Control; or (D) permitting or requiring Participants to surrender outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights in exchange for a cash payment, if any, equal to the difference between the highest price paid for a Share in the Change of Control and the exercise or settlement price of such Award. In addition, except as otherwise speciﬁed in an Award Document (or a Participant’s written employment agreement with the Company or any Subsidiary): (1) any and all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights outstanding as of the effective time of the Change of Control shall become immediately exercisable, and shall remain exercisable until the earlier of the expiration of their initial term or the second (2nd) anniversary of the Participant’s termination of employment with the Company; (2) any restrictions imposed on Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units outstanding as of the effective time of the Change of Control shall lapse; (3) the Performance Targets with respect to all Performance Units, Performance Stock and other performance-based Awards granted pursuant to Section 7 (g) or 11 outstanding as of the effective time of the Change of Control shall be deemed to have been attained at the speciﬁed target level of performance; and (4) the vesting of all Awards denominated in Shares outstanding as of the effective time of the Change in Control shall be accelerated. (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award Document, the provisions of this Section 7 (d) may not be terminated, amended, or modiﬁed upon or after a Change of Control in a manner that would adversely affect a Participant’s rights with respect to an outstanding Award without the prior written consent of the Participant. Subject to Section 17, the Board, upon recommendation of the Administrator, may terminate, amend or modify this Section 7 (d) at any time and from time to time prior to a Change of Control. (e) Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. The Administrator may provide Participants with the right to receive dividends or payments equivalent to dividends with respect to an outstanding Award, which payments can either be paid currently or deferred or be deemed to have been reinvested in Shares, and can be made in Shares, cash or a combination thereof, as the Administrator shall determine; provided, however, that the terms of any reinvestment of dividends must comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no dividends or dividend equivalents shall be paid with respect to Options or Stock Appreciation Rights. (f) Rights of a Stockholder. A Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to Shares covered by an Award (including voting rights) until the date the Participant or his nominee becomes the holder of record of such Shares. No adjustment shall be made for dividends or disbursements for which the record date is prior to such date, except as provided in Section 14. 716/04/2025, 06:26 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 7/14(g) Performance-Based Awards. (i) The Administrator may determine whether any Award under the Plan is intended to be “performance-based compensation” as that term is used in Section 162(m) of the Code. Any such Awards designated to be “performance-based compensation” shall be conditioned on the achievement of one or more Performance Targets to the extent required by Section 162(m) of the Code and will be subject to all other conditions and requirements of Section 162(m). The Performance Targets will be comprised of speciﬁed levels of one or more of the following performance criteria as the Administrator deems appropriate: net income; cash ﬂow or cash ﬂow on investment; pre-tax or post-tax proﬁt levels or earnings; operating earnings; return on investment; earned value added expense reduction levels; free cash ﬂow; free cash ﬂow per share; earnings per share; net earnings per share; return on assets; return on net assets; return on equity; return on capital; return on sales; growth in managed assets; operating margin; total stockholder return or stock price appreciation; EBITDA; adjusted EBITDA; revenue; revenue before deferral, in each case determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or in accordance with non-GAAP accounting historically used by the Company (subject to modiﬁcations approved by the Administrator) consistently applied on a business unit, divisional, subsidiary or consolidated basis or any combination thereof. The Performance Targets may be described in terms of objectives that are related to the individual Participant or objectives that are Company-wide or related to a Subsidiary, division, department, region, function or business unit and may be measured on an absolute or cumulative basis or on the basis of percentage of improvement over time, and may be measured in terms of Company performance (or performance of the applicable Subsidiary, division, department, region, function or business unit) or measured relative to selected peer companies or a market index. In addition, for Awards not intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator may establish Performance Targets based on other criteria as it deems appropriate. (ii) The Participants will be designated, and the applicable Performance Targets will be established, by the Administrator within ninety (90) days following the Administrator of the applicable Performance Period (or such earlier or later date permitted or required by Section 162(m) of the Code). Any payment of an Award granted with Performance Targets shall be conditioned on the written certiﬁcation of the Administrator in each case that the Performance Targets and any other material conditions were satisﬁed. The Administrator retains the right to reduce any Award notwithstanding the attainment of the Performance Targets. (h) Deferrals. In accordance with the procedures authorized by, and subject to the approval of, the Administrator, Participants may be given the opportunity to defer the payment or settlement of an Award to one or more dates selected by the Participant; provided, however, that the terms of any deferrals must comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, Section 409A of the Code. No deferral opportunity shall exist with respect to an Award unless explicitly permitted by the Administrator on or after the time of grant. (i) Repricing of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, an Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall not be granted in substitution for a previously granted Option or Stock Appreciation Right being canceled or surrendered as a condition of receiving a new Award, if the new Award would have a lower exercise price than the Award it replaces, nor shall the exercise price of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right be reduced once the Option or Stock Appreciation Right is granted. The foregoing shall not (i) prevent adjustments pursuant to Section 14 or (ii) apply to grants of Substitute Awards. 8. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS. (a) General. The Administrator, in its discretion, may grant Options to Eligible Individuals and shall determine whether such Options shall be Incentive Stock Options or Nonqualiﬁed Stock Options. Each Option shall be evidenced by an Award Document that shall expressly identify the Option as an Incentive Stock Option or Nonqualiﬁed Stock Option, and be in such form and contain such provisions as the Administrator shall from time to time deem appropriate. (b) Exercise Price. The exercise price of an Option shall be ﬁxed by the Administrator at the time of grant or shall be determined by a method speciﬁed by the Administrator at the time of grant. In no event shall the exercise price of an Option be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant; provided, however that the exercise price of a Substitute Award granted as an Option shall be determined so as to avoid excise or other taxes under Section 409A of the Code and may be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value. 816/04/2025, 06:26 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 8/14(c) Term. An Option shall be effective for such term as shall be determined by the Administrator and as set forth in the Award Document relating to such Option, and the Administrator may extend the term of an Option after the time of grant; provided, however, that the term of an Option may in no event extend beyond the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date of grant of such Option. (d) Exercise; Payment of Exercise Price. Options shall be exercised by delivery of a notice of exercise in a form approved by the Company. Subject to the provisions of the applicable Award Document, the exercise price of an Option may be paid (i) in cash or cash equivalents, (ii) by actual delivery or attestation to ownership of freely transferable Shares already owned by the person exercising the Option, (iii) by a combination of cash and Shares equal in value to the exercise price, (iv) through net share settlement or similar procedure involving the withholding of Shares subject to the Option with a value equal to the exercise price or (v) by such other means as the Administrator may authorize. In accordance with the rules and procedures authorized by the Administrator for this purpose, the Option may also be exercised through a “cashless exercise” procedure authorized by the Administrator from time to time that permits Participants to exercise Options by delivering irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds necessary to pay the exercise price and the amount of any required tax or other withholding obligations or such other procedures determined by the Company from time to time. (e) Incentive Stock Options. The exercise price per Share of an Incentive Stock Option shall be ﬁxed by the Administrator at the time of grant or shall be determined by a method speciﬁed by the Administrator at the time of grant, but in no event shall the exercise price of an Incentive Stock Option be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant. No Incentive Stock Option may be issued pursuant to the Plan to any individual who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, unless (i) the exercise price determined as of the date of grant is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant of the Shares subject to such Incentive Stock Option and (ii) the Incentive Stock Option is not exercisable more than ﬁve (5) years from the date of grant thereof. No Participant shall be granted any Incentive Stock Option which would result in such Participant receiving a grant of Incentive Stock Options that would have an aggregate Fair Market Value in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), determined as of the time of grant, that would be exercisable for the ﬁrst time by such Participant during any calendar year. No Incentive Stock Option may be granted under the Plan after the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date. The terms of any Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan shall comply in all respects with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, as amended from time to time. 9. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. (a) Restricted Stock. The Administrator, in its discretion, may grant or sell Restricted Stock to Eligible Individuals. An Award of Restricted Stock shall consist of one or more Shares granted or sold to an Eligible Individual, and shall be subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in the Plan and established by the Administrator in connection with the Award and speciﬁed in the applicable Award Document. Restricted Stock may, among other things, be subject to restrictions on transferability, vesting requirements or other speciﬁed circumstances under which it may be canceled. (b) Restricted Stock Units. The Administrator, in its discretion, may grant Restricted Stock Units to Eligible Individuals. A Restricted Stock Unit shall entitle a Participant to receive, subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in the Plan and the applicable Award Document, one or more Shares. Restricted Stock Units may, among other things, be subject to restrictions on , vesting requirements or other speciﬁed circumstances under which they may be canceled. If and when the cancellation provisions lapse, the Restricted Stock Units shall become Shares owned by the applicable Participant or, at the sole discretion of the Administrator, cash, or a combination of cash and Shares, with a value equal to the Fair Market Value of the Shares at the time of payment. 916/04/2025, 06:26 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 9/1410. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS. (a) General. The Administrator, in its discretion, may grant Stock Appreciation Rights to Eligible Individuals. A Stock Appreciation Right shall entitle a Participant to receive, upon satisfaction of the conditions to payment speciﬁed in the applicable Award Document, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value on the exercise date of the number of Shares for which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised over the grant price for such Stock Appreciation Right speciﬁed in the applicable Award Document. The grant price per share of Shares covered by a Stock Appreciation Right shall be ﬁxed by the Administrator at the time of grant or, alternatively, shall be determined by a method speciﬁed by the Administrator at the time of grant, but in no event shall the grant price of a Stock Appreciation Right be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant; provided, however, that the grant price of a Substitute Award granted as a Stock Appreciation Rights shall be determined so as to not result in excise or other taxes under Section 409A of the Code and may be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value. Payments to a Participant upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right may be made in cash or Shares, having an aggregate Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value on the exercise date of the number of Shares for which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised over the grant price for such Stock Appreciation Right. The term of a Stock Appreciation Right settled in Shares shall not exceed seven (7) years. (b) Stock Appreciation Rights in Tandem with Options. A Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Option may be granted either at the same time as such Option or subsequent thereto. If granted in tandem with an Option, a Stock Appreciation Right shall cover the same number of Shares as covered by the Option (or such lesser number of Shares as the Administrator may determine) and shall be exercisable only at such time or times and to the extent the related Option shall be exercisable, and shall have the same term as the related Option. The grant price of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Option shall equal the per-share exercise price of the Option to which it relates. Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Option, the related Option shall be canceled automatically to the extent of the number of Shares covered by such exercise; conversely, if the related Option is exercised as to some or all of the Shares covered by the tandem grant, the tandem Stock Appreciation Right shall be canceled automatically to the extent of the number of Shares covered by the Option exercise. 11. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERFORMANCE STOCK AND PERFORMANCE UNITS. (a) Performance Stock. The Administrator may grant Performance Stock to Eligible Individuals. An Award of Performance Stock shall consist of such number of Shares determined by the Administrator and granted to an Eligible Individual based on the achievement of Performance Targets over the applicable Performance Period, and shall be subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in the Plan and established by the Administrator in connection with the Award and speciﬁed in the applicable Award Document. (b) Performance Units. The Administrator, in its discretion, may grant Performance Units to Eligible Individuals. A Performance Unit shall entitle a Participant to receive, subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in the Plan and established by the Administrator in connection with the Award and speciﬁed in the applicable Award Document, such number of Shares or cash determined by the Administrator and based upon the achievement of Performance Targets over the applicable Performance Period. At the sole discretion of the Administrator, Performance Units shall be settled through the delivery of Shares or cash, or a combination of cash and Shares, with a value equal to the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares as of the last day of the applicable Performance Period. 12. OTHER AWARDS. The Administrator shall have the authority to specify the terms and provisions of cash, stock or other equity-based or equity-related awards not described above that the Administrator determines to be consistent with the purpose of the Plan and the interests of the Company. 1016/04/2025, 06:26 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 10/1413. CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS. (a) Transfers. No Award shall be transferable other than pursuant to a beneﬁciary designation under Section 13 (c), by last will and testament or by the laws of descent and distribution or, except in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, pursuant to a domestic relations order, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Administrator may, subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations and such terms and conditions as it shall specify, permit the transfer of an Award, other than an Incentive Stock Option, for no consideration to a Permitted Transferee of the relevant participant. Any Award transferred to a Permitted Transferee shall be further transferable only by last will and testament or the laws of descent and distribution or, for no consideration, to another Permitted Transferee of the relevant Participant. (b) Award Exercisable Only by Participant. During the lifetime of a Participant, an Award shall be exercisable only by the Participant or by a Permitted Transferee to whom such Award has been transferred in accordance with Section 13 (a). The grant of an Award shall impose no obligation on a Participant to exercise or settle the Award. (c) Beneﬁciary Designation. The beneﬁciary or beneﬁciaries of the Participant to whom any beneﬁt under the Plan is to be paid in case of his death before he receives any or all of such beneﬁt shall be determined under the Company’s Group Life Insurance Plan. A Participant may, from time to time, name any beneﬁciary or beneﬁciaries to receive any beneﬁt in case of his death before he receives any or all of such beneﬁt. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, including the beneﬁciary designated under the Company’s Group Life Insurance Plan, and will be effective only when ﬁled by the Participant in writing (in such form or manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator) with the Company during the Participant’s lifetime. In the absence of a valid designation under the Company’s Group Life Insurance Plan or otherwise, if no validly designated beneﬁciary survives the Participant or if each surviving validly designated beneﬁciary is legally impaired or prohibited from receiving the beneﬁts under an Award, the Participant’s beneﬁciary shall be the Participant’s estate. 14. RECAPITALIZATION OR REORGANIZATION. (a) Authority of the Company and Stockholders. Neither the Plan nor any Award Documents or Awards shall affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the Company or the stockholders to make or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company’s capital structure or business, any merger or consolidation of the Company, any issue of stock or of options, warrants or rights to purchase stock or of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stocks whose rights are superior to or affect the Shares or the rights thereof or which are convertible into or exchangeable for Shares, or the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise. (b) Change in Capitalization. The number and kind of Shares authorized for issuance under Section 6, including the maximum number of Shares available under the special limits provided for in Section 6 (c), may be equitably adjusted in the sole discretion of the Administrator in the event of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation, reclassiﬁcation, merger, consolidation, separation, extraordinary cash dividend, split-up, spin-off, combination, exchange of Shares, warrants or rights offering to purchase Shares at a price substantially below Fair Market Value, or any other corporate event or distribution of stock or property of the Company affecting the Shares in order to preserve, but not increase, the beneﬁts or potential beneﬁts intended to be made available under the Plan. In addition, upon the occurrence of any of the foregoing events, the number and kind of Shares subject to any outstanding Award and the exercise or settlement price, under any outstanding Award may be equitably adjusted (including by payment of cash to a Participant) in the sole discretion of the Administrator in order to preserve the beneﬁts or potential beneﬁts intended to be made available to Participants. 1116/04/2025, 06:26 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 11/1415. TERM OF THE PLAN. Unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 17, the Plan shall terminate on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Date, except with respect to Awards then outstanding. No Awards may be granted under the Plan after the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Date. 16. EFFECTIVE DATE. The Plan shall become effective on the date on which it is approved by the stockholders. 17. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION. Subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Board may at any time terminate or, from time to time, amend, modify or suspend the Plan; provided, however, that no termination, amendment, modiﬁcation or suspension (i) will be effective without the approval of the stockholders of the Company if such approval is required under applicable laws, rules and regulations, including the rules of NASDAQ and (ii) shall materially and adversely alter or impair the rights of a Participant in any Award previously made under the Plan without the consent of the holder thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board shall have broad authority to amend the Plan or any Award without the consent of a Participant to the extent it deems necessary or desirable (a) to comply with, take into account changes in, or interpretations of, applicable tax laws, securities laws, employment laws, accounting rules and other applicable laws, rules and regulations, (b) to take into account unusual or nonrecurring events or market conditions (including, without limitation, the events described in Section 14 (b)), or (c) to take into account signiﬁcant acquisitions or dispositions of assets or other property by the Company or its Subsidiaries. 18. MISCELLANEOUS. (a) Tax Withholding. The Company or a Subsidiary, as appropriate, may require any individual entitled to receive a payment or settlement of an Award to remit to the Company, prior to payment or settlement, an amount sufﬁcient to satisfy any applicable tax withholding requirements. In the case of an Award payable in Shares, the Company or a Subsidiary, as appropriate, may permit a Participant to satisfy, in whole or in part, such obligation to remit taxes by directing the Company to withhold Shares that would otherwise be received by such individual or to deliver Shares then owned by the Participant, in accordance with all applicable laws and pursuant to such rules as the Administrator may establish from time to time. The Company or a Subsidiary, as appropriate, shall also have the right to deduct from all cash to be paid to a Participant (whether or not made in connection with an Award) any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payments, rules and regulations. (b) No Right to Awards or Employment. No person shall have any claim or right to receive Awards under the Plan. Neither the Plan, the grant of Awards nor any action taken or omitted to be taken under the Plan shall be deemed to create or confer on any Eligible Individual any right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary, or to interfere with or to limit in any way the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate the employment of such Eligible Individual at any time. No Award shall constitute salary or other recurrent compensation. Payments received by a Participant under any Award made pursuant to the Plan shall not be included in, nor have any effect on, the determination of employment-related rights or beneﬁts under any other employee beneﬁt plan or similar arrangement provided by the Company and the Subsidiaries, unless otherwise speciﬁcally provided for under the terms of such plan or arrangement or by the Administrator. (c) Securities Law Restrictions. An Award may not be exercised or settled, and no Shares may be issued in connection with an Award, unless the issuance of such Shares (i) has been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (ii) has been registered or qualiﬁed under applicable state “blue sky” laws (or the Company has determined that an exemption from registration and from qualiﬁcation under such state “blue sky” laws is available) and (iii) complies with all applicable foreign securities laws. The Administrator may require each Participant purchasing or acquiring Shares pursuant to an Award under the Plan to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that such Participant is acquiring the Shares for investment purposes and not with a view to the distribution thereof. All certiﬁcates for Shares delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stock-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Administrator may deem advisable under rules and regulations and rules of any exchange upon which the Shares are then listed, and the Administrator may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certiﬁcates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. 1216/04/2025, 06:26 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 12/14(d) Section 162(m) of the Code. As to any Award that constitutes or may constitute “qualiﬁed performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code to the extent necessary to result in deductibility of such compensation; provided, however, that, in the event the Administrator determines that compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code is not desired with respect to a particular Award, compliance with such requirements will not be required. If any provision of the Plan would cause Awards that are intended to constitute “qualiﬁed performance-based compensation” to fail to so qualify, that provision shall be severed from, and shall be deemed not to be a part of, the Plan, but the other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect. (e) Section 409A of the Code. As to any Award that constitutes or may constitute “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, the Plan is intended to comply with the requirement of Section 409A of the Code to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of any excise or other additional tax, accelerated taxation, interest or penalty on the compensation represented by such Award. If any provision of the Plan or an Award Document would cause an Award to be subject to additional tax, accelerated taxation, interest and/or penalties under Section 409A of the Code, such provision of the Plan or Award Document may be modiﬁed by the Administrator without consent of the Participant in any manner the Administrator deems desirable or necessary. In making such modiﬁcations the Administrator shall attempt, but shall not be obligated, to maintain, to the maximum extent practicable, the original intent of the applicable provision. Any discretionary authority that the Administrator may have pursuant to the Plan shall not be applicable cause the plan not to comply with such requirements. (f) Awards to Individuals Subject to Laws of a Jurisdiction Outside of the United States. To the extent that Awards are granted to Participants who are domiciled or resident outside of the United States or to persons who are domiciled or resident in the United States but who are subject to the tax laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States, the Administrator may adjust the terms of such Awards to such person to (i) comply with the laws, rules and regulations of such jurisdiction and to (ii) permit the grant of such Awards not to be a taxable event to the Participants. The authority granted under the previous sentence shall include the discretion for the Administrator to adopt, on behalf of the Company, one or more sub-plans applicable to separate classes of Eligible Individuals who are so domiciled or resident. (g) Satisfaction of Obligations. Subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Company may apply any cash, Shares, securities or other consideration received upon exercise or settlement of an Award to any obligations a Participant owes to the Company and the Subsidiaries in connection with the Plan or otherwise, including, without limitation, any tax obligations in connection with the Plan or otherwise. (h) No Limitation on Corporate Actions. Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed to prevent the Company or any Subsidiary from taking any corporate action, whether or not such action would have an adverse effect on any Awards. No Participant, beneﬁciary or other person shall have any claim against the Company or any Subsidiary as a result of any such action. (i) Unfunded Plan. The Plan is intended to constitute an unfunded plan for incentive compensation. Prior to the issuance of Shares, cash or other form of consideration in connection with an Award, nothing contained herein shall give any Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company.

(d) Substitute Awards. Any Shares underlying Substitute Awards shall not be counted against the number of Shares issuable hereunder and shall not be subject to Section 6 (c). (e) Legal Compliance.

(b) Terms Set Forth in Award Document. The terms and conditions of each Award shall be set forth in an Award Document in a form and with terms and conditions approved by the Administrator, which Award Document shall contain terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Administrator may accelerate (i) the vesting or payment of any Award, (ii) the lapse of restrictions on any Award or (iii) the date on which any Award ﬁrst becomes exercisable. The terms of Awards may vary among Participants, and the Plan does not impose upon the Administrator any requirement to make Awards subject to uniform terms. (c) Termination of Employment. The Administrator shall specify at or after the time of grant of an Award the provisions governing the disposition of an Award in the event of a Participant’s termination of employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, in connection with a Participant’s termination of employment, the Administrator shall have the discretion to accelerate the vesting, exercisability or settlement of, eliminate the restrictions and conditions applicable to, or extend the post-termination exercise period of an outstanding Award. Such provisions may be speciﬁed in the applicable Award Document or determined at a subsequent time. 616/04/2025, 06:26 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 6/14(d) Change of Control. (i) The Administrator shall have full authority to determine the effect, if any, of a Change of Control (or similar events, as determined by the Administrator) on the vesting, exercisability, settlement, payment, lapse of restrictions or other terms and conditions applicable to an Award, which effect may be speciﬁed in the applicable Award Document or determined at a subsequent time. Subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Administrator may, at any time prior to, coincident with or after the effective time of a Change of Control, take such actions as it may consider necessary or desirable, including, without limitation: (A) providing for the acceleration of any vesting conditions relating to the exercise or settlement of an Award or that an Award shall terminate or expire unless exercised or settled in full on or before a date ﬁxed by the Administrator; (B) making such adjustments to an Awards to reﬂect such Change of Control; (C) causing Awards to be assumed, or new rights to be substituted therefor, by the surviving corporation or other entity in such Change of Control; or (D) permitting or requiring Participants to surrender outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights in exchange for a cash payment, if any, equal to the difference between the highest price paid for a Share in the Change of Control and the exercise or settlement price of such Award. In addition, except as otherwise speciﬁed in an Award Document (or a Participant’s written employment agreement with the Company or any Subsidiary): (1) any and all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights outstanding as of the effective time of the Change of Control shall become immediately exercisable, and shall remain exercisable until the earlier of the expiration of their initial term or the second (2nd) anniversary of the Participant’s termination of employment with the Company; (2) any restrictions imposed on Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units outstanding as of the effective time of the Change of Control shall lapse; (3) the Performance Targets with respect to all Performance Units, Performance Stock and other performance-based Awards granted pursuant to Section 7 (g) or 11 outstanding as of the effective time of the Change of Control shall be deemed to have been attained at the speciﬁed target level of performance; and (4) the vesting of all Awards denominated in Shares outstanding as of the effective time of the Change in Control shall be accelerated. (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award Document, the provisions of this Section 7 (d) may not be terminated, amended, or modiﬁed upon or after a Change of Control in a manner that would adversely affect a Participant’s rights with respect to an outstanding Award without the prior written consent of the Participant. Subject to Section 17, the Board, upon recommendation of the Administrator, may terminate, amend or modify this Section 7 (d) at any time and from time to time prior to a Change of Control. (e) Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. The Administrator may provide Participants with the right to receive dividends or payments equivalent to dividends with respect to an outstanding Award, which payments can either be paid currently or deferred or be deemed to have been reinvested in Shares, and can be made in Shares, cash or a combination thereof, as the Administrator shall determine; provided, however, that the terms of any reinvestment of dividends must comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no dividends or dividend equivalents shall be paid with respect to Options or Stock Appreciation Rights. (f) Rights of a Stockholder. A Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to Shares covered by an Award (including voting rights) until the date the Participant or his nominee becomes the holder of record of such Shares. No adjustment shall be made for dividends or disbursements for which the record date is prior to such date, except as provided in Section 14. 716/04/2025, 06:26 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 7/14(g) Performance-Based Awards. (i) The Administrator may determine whether any Award under the Plan is intended to be “performance-based compensation” as that term is used in Section 162(m) of the Code. Any such Awards designated to be “performance-based compensation” shall be conditioned on the achievement of one or more Performance Targets to the extent required by Section 162(m) of the Code and will be subject to all other conditions and requirements of Section 162(m). The Performance Targets will be comprised of speciﬁed levels of one or more of the following performance criteria as the Administrator deems appropriate: net income; cash ﬂow or cash ﬂow on investment; pre-tax or post-tax proﬁt levels or earnings; operating earnings; return on investment; earned value added expense reduction levels; free cash ﬂow; free cash ﬂow per share; earnings per share; net earnings per share; return on assets; return on net assets; return on equity; return on capital; return on sales; growth in managed assets; operating margin; total stockholder return or stock price appreciation; EBITDA; adjusted EBITDA; revenue; revenue before deferral, in each case determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or in accordance with non-GAAP accounting historically used by the Company (subject to modiﬁcations approved by the Administrator) consistently applied on a business unit, divisional, subsidiary or consolidated basis or any combination thereof. The Performance Targets may be described in terms of objectives that are related to the individual Participant or objectives that are Company-wide or related to a Subsidiary, division, department, region, function or business unit and may be measured on an absolute or cumulative basis or on the basis of percentage of improvement over time, and may be measured in terms of Company performance (or performance of the applicable Subsidiary, division, department, region, function or business unit) or measured relative to selected peer companies or a market index. In addition, for Awards not intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator may establish Performance Targets based on other criteria as it deems appropriate. (ii) The Participants will be designated, and the applicable Performance Targets will be established, by the Administrator within ninety (90) days following the Administrator of the applicable Performance Period (or such earlier or later date permitted or required by Section 162(m) of the Code). Any payment of an Award granted with Performance Targets shall be conditioned on the written certiﬁcation of the Administrator in each case that the Performance Targets and any other material conditions were satisﬁed. The Administrator retains the right to reduce any Award notwithstanding the attainment of the Performance Targets. (h) Deferrals. In accordance with the procedures authorized by, and subject to the approval of, the Administrator, Participants may be given the opportunity to defer the payment or settlement of an Award to one or more dates selected by the Participant; provided, however, that the terms of any deferrals must comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, Section 409A of the Code. No deferral opportunity shall exist with respect to an Award unless explicitly permitted by the Administrator on or after the time of grant. (i) Repricing of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, an Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall not be granted in substitution for a previously granted Option or Stock Appreciation Right being canceled or surrendered as a condition of receiving a new Award, if the new Award would have a lower exercise price than the Award it replaces, nor shall the exercise price of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right be reduced once the Option or Stock Appreciation Right is granted. The foregoing shall not (i) prevent adjustments pursuant to Section 14 or (ii) apply to grants of Substitute Awards. 8. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS. (a) General. The Administrator, in its discretion, may grant Options to Eligible Individuals and shall determine whether such Options shall be Incentive Stock Options or Nonqualiﬁed Stock Options.

An Option shall be effective for such term as shall be determined by the Administrator and as set forth in the Award Document relating to such Option, and the Administrator may extend the term of an Option after the time of grant; provided, however, that the term of an Option may in no event extend beyond the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date of grant of such Option. (d) Exercise; Payment of Exercise Price. Options shall be exercised by delivery of a notice of exercise in a form approved by the Company. Subject to the provisions of the applicable Award Document, the exercise price of an Option may be paid (i) in cash or cash equivalents, (ii) by actual delivery or attestation to ownership of freely transferable Shares already owned by the person exercising the Option, (iii) by a combination of cash and Shares equal in value to the exercise price, (iv) through net share settlement or similar procedure involving the withholding of Shares subject to the Option with a value equal to the exercise price or (v) by such other means as the Administrator may authorize. In accordance with the rules and procedures authorized by the Administrator for this purpose, the Option may also be exercised through a “cashless exercise” procedure authorized by the Administrator from time to time that permits Participants to exercise Options by delivering irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds necessary to pay the exercise price and the amount of any required tax or other withholding obligations or such other procedures determined by the Company from time to time. (e) Incentive Stock Options. The exercise price per Share of an Incentive Stock Option shall be ﬁxed by the Administrator at the time of grant or shall be determined by a method speciﬁed by the Administrator at the time of grant, but in no event shall the exercise price of an Incentive Stock Option be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant. No Incentive Stock Option may be issued pursuant to the Plan to any individual who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, unless (i) the exercise price determined as of the date of grant is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant of the Shares subject to such Incentive Stock Option and (ii) the Incentive Stock Option is not exercisable more than ﬁve (5) years from the date of grant thereof. No Participant shall be granted any Incentive Stock Option which would result in such Participant receiving a grant of Incentive Stock Options that would have an aggregate Fair Market Value in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), determined as of the time of grant, that would be exercisable for the ﬁrst time by such Participant during any calendar year. No Incentive Stock Option may be granted under the Plan after the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date. The terms of any Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan shall comply in all respects with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, as amended from time to time. 9.

Restricted Stock may, among other things, be subject to restrictions on transferability, vesting requirements or other speciﬁed circumstances under which it may be canceled. (b) Restricted Stock Units. The Administrator, in its discretion, may grant Restricted Stock Units to Eligible Individuals. A Restricted Stock Unit shall entitle a Participant to receive, subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in the Plan and the applicable Award Document, one or more Shares.

STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS. (a) General. The Administrator, in its discretion, may grant Stock Appreciation Rights to Eligible Individuals. A Stock Appreciation Right shall entitle a Participant to receive, upon satisfaction of the conditions to payment speciﬁed in the applicable Award Document, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value on the exercise date of the number of Shares for which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised over the grant price for such Stock Appreciation Right speciﬁed in the applicable Award Document. The grant price per share of Shares covered by a Stock Appreciation Right shall be ﬁxed by the Administrator at the time of grant or, alternatively, shall be determined by a method speciﬁed by the Administrator at the time of grant, but in no event shall the grant price of a Stock Appreciation Right be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant; provided, however, that the grant price of a Substitute Award granted as a Stock Appreciation Rights shall be determined so as to not result in excise or other taxes under Section 409A of the Code and may be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value. Payments to a Participant upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right may be made in cash or Shares, having an aggregate Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value on the exercise date of the number of Shares for which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised over the grant price for such Stock Appreciation Right. The term of a Stock Appreciation Right settled in Shares shall not exceed seven (7) years. (b) Stock Appreciation Rights in Tandem with Options. A Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Option may be granted either at the same time as such Option or subsequent thereto. If granted in tandem with an Option, a Stock Appreciation Right shall cover the same number of Shares as covered by the Option (or such lesser number of Shares as the Administrator may determine) and shall be exercisable only at such time or times and to the extent the related Option shall be exercisable, and shall have the same term as the related Option. The grant price of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Option shall equal the per-share exercise price of the Option to which it relates. Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Option, the related Option shall be canceled automatically to the extent of the number of Shares covered by such exercise; conversely, if the related Option is exercised as to some or all of the Shares covered by the tandem grant, the tandem Stock Appreciation Right shall be canceled automatically to the extent of the number of Shares covered by the Option exercise. 11. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERFORMANCE STOCK AND PERFORMANCE UNITS. (a) Performance Stock. The Administrator may grant Performance Stock to Eligible Individuals. An Award of Performance Stock shall consist of such number of Shares determined by the Administrator and granted to an Eligible Individual based on the achievement of Performance Targets over the applicable Performance Period, and shall be subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in the Plan and established by the Administrator in connection with the Award and speciﬁed in the applicable Award Document.

At the sole discretion of the Administrator, Performance Units shall be settled through the delivery of Shares or cash, or a combination of cash and Shares, with a value equal to the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares as of the last day of the applicable Performance Period. 12. OTHER AWARDS. The Administrator shall have the authority to specify the terms and provisions of cash, stock or other equity-based or equity-related awards not described above that the Administrator determines to be consistent with the purpose of the Plan and the interests of the Company. 1016/04/2025, 06:26 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 10/1413. CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS. (a) Transfers. No Award shall be transferable other than pursuant to a beneﬁciary designation under Section 13 (c), by last will and testament or by the laws of descent and distribution or, except in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, pursuant to a domestic relations order, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Administrator may, subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations and such terms and conditions as it shall specify, permit the transfer of an Award, other than an Incentive Stock Option, for no consideration to a Permitted Transferee of the relevant participant. Any Award transferred to a Permitted Transferee shall be further transferable only by last will and testament or the laws of descent and distribution or, for no consideration, to another Permitted Transferee of the relevant Participant. (b) Award Exercisable Only by Participant. During the lifetime of a Participant, an Award shall be exercisable only by the Participant or by a Permitted Transferee to whom such Award has been transferred in accordance with Section 13 (a). The grant of an Award shall impose no obligation on a Participant to exercise or settle the Award. (c) Beneﬁciary Designation. The beneﬁciary or beneﬁciaries of the Participant to whom any beneﬁt under the Plan is to be paid in case of his death before he receives any or all of such beneﬁt shall be determined under the Company’s Group Life Insurance Plan. A Participant may, from time to time, name any beneﬁciary or beneﬁciaries to receive any beneﬁt in case of his death before he receives any or all of such beneﬁt. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, including the beneﬁciary designated under the Company’s Group Life Insurance Plan, and will be effective only when ﬁled by the Participant in writing (in such form or manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator) with the Company during the Participant’s lifetime. In the absence of a valid designation under the Company’s Group Life Insurance Plan or otherwise, if no validly designated beneﬁciary survives the Participant or if each surviving validly designated beneﬁciary is legally impaired or prohibited from receiving the beneﬁts under an Award, the Participant’s beneﬁciary shall be the Participant’s estate. 14. RECAPITALIZATION OR REORGANIZATION. (a) Authority of the Company and Stockholders. Neither the Plan nor any Award Documents or Awards shall affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the Company or the stockholders to make or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company’s capital structure or business, any merger or consolidation of the Company, any issue of stock or of options, warrants or rights to purchase stock or of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stocks whose rights are superior to or affect the Shares or the rights thereof or which are convertible into or exchangeable for Shares, or the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise. (b) Change in Capitalization. The number and kind of Shares authorized for issuance under Section 6, including the maximum number of Shares available under the special limits provided for in Section 6 (c), may be equitably adjusted in the sole discretion of the Administrator in the event of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation, reclassiﬁcation, merger, consolidation, separation, extraordinary cash dividend, split-up, spin-off, combination, exchange of Shares, warrants or rights offering to purchase Shares at a price substantially below Fair Market Value, or any other corporate event or distribution of stock or property of the Company affecting the Shares in order to preserve, but not increase, the beneﬁts or potential beneﬁts intended to be made available under the Plan. In addition, upon the occurrence of any of the foregoing events, the number and kind of Shares subject to any outstanding Award and the exercise or settlement price, under any outstanding Award may be equitably adjusted (including by payment of cash to a Participant) in the sole discretion of the Administrator in order to preserve the beneﬁts or potential beneﬁts intended to be made available to Participants. 1116/04/2025, 06:26 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 11/1415. TERM OF THE PLAN. Unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 17, the Plan shall terminate on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Date, except with respect to Awards then outstanding. No Awards may be granted under the Plan after the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Date. 16. EFFECTIVE DATE. The Plan shall become effective on the date on which it is approved by the stockholders. 17. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION. Subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Board may at any time terminate or, from time to time, amend, modify or suspend the Plan; provided, however, that no termination, amendment, modiﬁcation or suspension (i) will be effective without the approval of the stockholders of the Company if such approval is required under applicable laws, rules and regulations, including the rules of NASDAQ and (ii) shall materially and adversely alter or impair the rights of a Participant in any Award previously made under the Plan without the consent of the holder thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board shall have broad authority to amend the Plan or any Award without the consent of a Participant to the extent it deems necessary or desirable (a) to comply with, take into account changes in, or interpretations of, applicable tax laws, securities laws, employment laws, accounting rules and other applicable laws, rules and regulations, (b) to take into account unusual or nonrecurring events or market conditions (including, without limitation, the events described in Section 14 (b)), or (c) to take into account signiﬁcant acquisitions or dispositions of assets or other property by the Company or its Subsidiaries. 18. MISCELLANEOUS. (a) Tax Withholding. The Company or a Subsidiary, as appropriate, may require any individual entitled to receive a payment or settlement of an Award to remit to the Company, prior to payment or settlement, an amount sufﬁcient to satisfy any applicable tax withholding requirements. In the case of an Award payable in Shares, the Company or a Subsidiary, as appropriate, may permit a Participant to satisfy, in whole or in part, such obligation to remit taxes by directing the Company to withhold Shares that would otherwise be received by such individual or to deliver Shares then owned by the Participant, in accordance with all applicable laws and pursuant to such rules as the Administrator may establish from time to time. The Company or a Subsidiary, as appropriate, shall also have the right to deduct from all cash to be paid to a Participant (whether or not made in connection with an Award) any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payments, rules and regulations. (b) No Right to Awards or Employment. No person shall have any claim or right to receive Awards under the Plan. Neither the Plan, the grant of Awards nor any action taken or omitted to be taken under the Plan shall be deemed to create or confer on any Eligible Individual any right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary, or to interfere with or to limit in any way the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate the employment of such Eligible Individual at any time. No Award shall constitute salary or other recurrent compensation. Payments received by a Participant under any Award made pursuant to the Plan shall not be included in, nor have any effect on, the determination of employment-related rights or beneﬁts under any other employee beneﬁt plan or similar arrangement provided by the Company and the Subsidiaries, unless otherwise speciﬁcally provided for under the terms of such plan or arrangement or by the Administrator. (c) Securities Law Restrictions. An Award may not be exercised or settled, and no Shares may be issued in connection with an Award, unless the issuance of such Shares (i) has been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (ii) has been registered or qualiﬁed under applicable state “blue sky” laws (or the Company has determined that an exemption from registration and from qualiﬁcation under such state “blue sky” laws is available) and (iii) complies with all applicable foreign securities laws. The Administrator may require each Participant purchasing or acquiring Shares pursuant to an Award under the Plan to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that such Participant is acquiring the Shares for investment purposes and not with a view to the distribution thereof. All certiﬁcates for Shares delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stock-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Administrator may deem advisable under rules and regulations and rules of any exchange upon which the Shares are then listed, and the Administrator may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certiﬁcates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. 1216/04/2025, 06:26 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 12/14(d) Section 162(m) of the Code. As to any Award that constitutes or may constitute “qualiﬁed performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code to the extent necessary to result in deductibility of such compensation; provided, however, that, in the event the Administrator determines that compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code is not desired with respect to a particular Award, compliance with such requirements will not be required. If any provision of the Plan would cause Awards that are intended to constitute “qualiﬁed performance-based compensation” to fail to so qualify, that provision shall be severed from, and shall be deemed not to be a part of, the Plan, but the other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect. (e) Section 409A of the Code. As to any Award that constitutes or may constitute “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, the Plan is intended to comply with the requirement of Section 409A of the Code to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of any excise or other additional tax, accelerated taxation, interest or penalty on the compensation represented by such Award. If any provision of the Plan or an Award Document would cause an Award to be subject to additional tax, accelerated taxation, interest and/or penalties under Section 409A of the Code, such provision of the Plan or Award Document may be modiﬁed by the Administrator without consent of the Participant in any manner the Administrator deems desirable or necessary. In making such modiﬁcations the Administrator shall attempt, but shall not be obligated, to maintain, to the maximum extent practicable, the original intent of the applicable provision. Any discretionary authority that the Administrator may have pursuant to the Plan shall not be applicable cause the plan not to comply with such requirements. (f) Awards to Individuals Subject to Laws of a Jurisdiction Outside of the United States. To the extent that Awards are granted to Participants who are domiciled or resident outside of the United States or to persons who are domiciled or resident in the United States but who are subject to the tax laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States, the Administrator may adjust the terms of such Awards to such person to (i) comply with the laws, rules and regulations of such jurisdiction and to (ii) permit the grant of such Awards not to be a taxable event to the Participants. The authority granted under the previous sentence shall include the discretion for the Administrator to adopt, on behalf of the Company, one or more sub-plans applicable to separate classes of Eligible Individuals who are so domiciled or resident. (g) Satisfaction of Obligations. Subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Company may apply any cash, Shares, securities or other consideration received upon exercise or settlement of an Award to any obligations a Participant owes to the Company and the Subsidiaries in connection with the Plan or otherwise, including, without limitation, any tax obligations in connection with the Plan or otherwise. (h) No Limitation on Corporate Actions. Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed to prevent the Company or any Subsidiary from taking any corporate action, whether or not such action would have an adverse effect on any Awards. No Participant, beneﬁciary or other person shall have any claim against the Company or any Subsidiary as a result of any such action. (i) Unfunded Plan. The Plan is intended to constitute an unfunded plan for incentive compensation. Prior to the issuance of Shares, cash or other form of consideration in connection with an Award, nothing contained herein shall give any Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company. The Administrator may, but is not obligated, to authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver Shares, cash or other forms of consideration with respect to Awards hereunder. (j) Successors. All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect, merger, consolidation, sales of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or otherwise. (k) Application of Funds. The proceeds received by the Company from the sale of Shares pursuant to Awards will be used for general corporate purposes. (l) Award Document. In the event of any conﬂict or inconsistency between the Plan and any Award Document, the Plan shall govern and the Award Document shall be interpreted to minimize or eliminate any such conﬂict or inconsistency. 1316/04/2025, 06:26 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 13/14(m) Headings. The headings of Sections herein are included solely for convenience of reference and shall not affect the meaning of any of the provisions of the Plan. (n) Severability. If any provision of this Plan is held unenforceable, the remainder of the Plan shall continue in full force and effect without regard to such unenforceable provision and shall be applied as though the unenforceable provision were not contained in the Plan. (o) Expenses. The costs and expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company. (p) Arbitration. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Plan that cannot be resolved by the Participant, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, shall be submitted to arbitration in the State of Connecticut under the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration Association; provided, however, that all disputes, controversies and claims by the Participant that are not properly submitted to such arbitration by the participant within one (1) year of the date of the events giving rise to such dispute, controversy or claim are waived, released and forfeited. The determination of the arbitrator shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and the Participant, and judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s award in any court having jurisdiction. The expenses of such arbitration shall be borne by the Company; provided, however, that each party shall bear its own legal expenses unless the Participant is the prevailing party, in which case the Company shall promptly pay or reimburse the Participant for the reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the Participant in connection with such arbitration (excluding any fees payable pursuant to a contingency fee arrangement). (q) Governing Law. Except as to matters of federal law, the Plan and all actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Connecticut. (r) Notice. All notices and other communications required or permitted to be given under this Plan shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered personally or mailed ﬁrst class, postage prepaid, as follows: (i) If to the Company – at its principal business address to the attention the Secretary. (ii) If to any Participant – at the last address of the Participant known to the sender at the time the notice or other communication is sent. (iii) In either event, notice may also be delivered via email as long as the email account is one used in the regular course of business of the Participant or Company representative. 1416/04/2025, 06:26 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037543 14/14"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"clause_text\": \"Company may require you to work from another location with short notice.\", \"clause_type\": \"Work Location\", \"compliance_status\": \"Non-Compliant\", \"legal_justification\": \"Unilateral change in work location may be deemed unfair.\"}"}]}

Executive will, from time to time, as may be reasonably requested by the Company , and at the Company’ s sole expense, sign such documents and assist the Company to establish or document the Company’ s exclusive ownership of any and all rights in any such results and proceeds, including, without limitation, the execution of appropriate copyright or patent applications or assignments. To the extent Executive has any rights in any such results and proceeds that cannot be assigned in the manner described above, Executive unconditionally and irrevocably waives the right to enforce such unassignable rights. This Section 10(d) is subject to, and will not be deemed to limit, restrict or constitute any waiver by the Company of, any rights of ownership to which the Company may be entitled by operation of law by virtue of the Company being Executive’ s employer . This Agreement does not apply to an invention or other works of authorship for which no equipment, supplies, facility or trade secret information of the Company was used and which was developed entirely on Executive’ s own time, and (i) which does not relate (A) directly to the business of the Company or (B) to 8 LEGAL_US_E # 168595263.6 16/04/2025, 06:35 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037140 8/32 the Company’ s actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (ii) which does not result from any work performed by Executive for the Company hereunder . (e)Enforcement; Remedies . Executive acknowledges that the covenants set forth in Sections 10(a) , 10(b) , 10(c) and 10(d) impose a reasonable restraint on Executive in light of the business and activities of the Company and its Affiliates. Executive acknowledges that a breach of Sections 10(a) , 10(b) , 10(c) or 10(d) by Executive may cause serious and potentially irreparable harm to the Company and its Affiliates. Executive therefore acknowledges that a breach of Sections 10(a) , 10(b) , 10(c) or 10(d) by Executive cannot be adequately compensated in an action for damages at law , and equitable relief may be necessary to protect the Company and its Affiliates from a violation of this Agreement and from the harm which this Agreement is intended to prevent. By reason thereof, Executive acknowledges that the Company may be entitled, in addition to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement or otherwise, to preliminary and permanent injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent or curtail any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. Executive acknowledges, however , that no specification in this Agreement of a specific legal or equitable remedy may be construed as a waiver of or prohibition against pursuing other legal or equitable remedies in the event of a breach of this Agreement by Executive. (f)Modification . In the event that any provision or term of Sections 10(a) , 10(b) , 10(c) or 10(d) , or any word, phrase, clause, sentence or other portion thereof (including, without limitation, the geographic and temporal restrictions and provisions contained in Sections 10(a) or 10(b) ) is held to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, such provision or portion thereof will be modified or deleted in such a manner as to be ef fective for the maximum period of time, the maximum geographical area, and otherwise to the maximum extent as to which it may be enforceable under applicable law . Such modified restriction(s) shall be enforced by a court having jurisdiction. In the event that a court finds certain provisions herein unenforceable and such modification is not possible, because each of Executive’ s obligations in Sections 10(a) , 10(b) , 10(c) and 10(d) is a separate and independent covenant, any unenforceable obligation shall be severed and all remaining obligations shall be enforceable. 11.Definitions .

Conﬁdential Information will not include any information that has been published (other than a disclosure by the Executive in breach of this Agreement) in a form generally available to the public prior to the date the Executive proposes to disclose or use such information. Conﬁdential Information will not be deemed to have been published merely because individual portions of the information have been separately published, but only if all material features comprising such information have been published in combination. (c) As used in this Agreement, the term “ Work Product ” means all inventions, innovations, improvements, technical information, systems, software developments, methods, designs, analyses, drawings, reports, service marks, trademarks, trade names, logos and all similar or related information (whether patentable or unpatentable, copyrightable, registerable as a trademark, reduced to writing, or otherwise) which relates to the Company’ s or any of its Afﬁliates’ actual or anticipated business, research and development or existing or future products or services and which are conceived, developed or made by the Executive (whether or not during usual business hours, whether or not by the use of the facilities of the Company or any of its Afﬁliates, and whether or not alone or in conjunction with any other person) while employed by the Company (including those conceived, developed or made prior to the Ef fective Date) together with all patent applications, letters patent, trademark, trade name and service mark applications or registrations, copyrights and reissues thereof that may be granted for or upon any of the foregoing.

Executive shall promptly disclose all Work Product to the Company , shall execute at the request of the Company any assignments or other documents the Company may deem necessary to protect or perfect its (or any of its Afﬁliates’, as applicable) rights therein, and shall assist the Company , at the Company’ s expense, in obtaining, defending and enforcing the Company’ s (or any of its Afﬁliates’, as applicable) rights therein. The Executive hereby appoints the Company as Executive’ s attorney-in-fact to execute on Executive’ s behalf any assignments or other documents deemed necessary by the Company to protect or perfect the Company’ s (and any of its Afﬁliates’, as applicable) rights to any Work Product. 6.2 Restriction on Competition . The Executive acknowledges that, in the course of Executive’ s employment with the Company and/or its Afﬁliates, he has 16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 32/511716/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 33/5118become familiar , or will become familiar , with the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ and their predecessors’ trade secrets and with other Conﬁdential Information concerning the Company , its Afﬁliates and their respective predecessors and that Executive’ s services have been and will be of special, unique and extraordinary value to the Company and its Afﬁliates. The Executive agrees that if the Executive were to become employed by , or substantially involved in, the business of a competitor of the Company or any of its Afﬁliates following the Severance Date, it would be very difﬁcult for the Executive not to rely on or use the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information. Thus, to avoid the inevitable disclosure of the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information, and to protect such trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information and the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ relationships and goodwill with customers, during the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person engage in, enter the employ of, render any services to, have any ownership interest in, nor participate in the ﬁnancing, operation, management or control of, any Competing Business. For purposes of this Agreement, the phrase “directly or indirectly through any other Person engage in” shall include, without limitation, any direct or indirect ownership or proﬁt participation interest in such enterprise, whether as an owner , stockholder , member , partner , joint venturer or otherwise, and shall include any direct or indirect participation in such enterprise as an employee, consultant, director , ofﬁcer , licensor of technology or otherwise. For purposes of this Agreement, “ Competing Business ” means a Person anywhere in the continental United States and elsewhere in the world where the Company and its Afﬁliates engage in business, or reasonably anticipate engaging in business, on the Severance Date (the “ Restricted Area ”) that at any time during the Period of Employment has competed, or at any time during the twelve month period following the Severance Date competes, with the Company or any of its Afﬁliates in the passenger cruise ship industry (the “ Business ”). Nothing herein shall prohibit the Executive from being a passive owner of not more than 2% of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation which is publicly traded, so long as the Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive and the Company may agree that the Company shall waive all or a portion of the non-competition restrictions provided for in this Section 6.2 in exchange for the Executive’ s agreement to forfeit all or a portion of the Severance Beneﬁt payable under Section 5.3(b), the Change in Control Severance Beneﬁt payable under Section 5.3(c) or retirement beneﬁts in Section 5.3(d). Any such agreement between the Executive and the Company shall be documented in the general release agreement provided for in Section 5.4 or in such other written agreement between the Executive and the Company determined by the Company . 6.3 Non-Solicitation of Employees and Consultants . During the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person (i) induce or attempt to induce any employee or independent contractor of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company to leave the employ or service, as applicable, of the 16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 34/5116/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 35/5119Company or such Afﬁliate, or in any way interfere with the relationship between the Company or any such Afﬁliate, on the one hand, and any employee or independent contractor thereof, on the other hand, or (ii) hire any person who was an employee of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company until twelve months after such individual’ s employment relationship with the Company or such Afﬁliate has been terminated. 6.4 Non-Solicitation of Customers . During the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person inﬂuence or attempt to inﬂuence customers, vendors, suppliers, licensors, lessors, joint venturers, associates, consultants, agents, or partners of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company to divert their business away from the Company or such Afﬁliate, and the Executive will not otherwise interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt the business relationships, contractual or otherwise, between the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company , on the one hand, and any of its or their customers, suppliers, vendors, lessors, licensors, joint venturers, associates, ofﬁcers, employees, consultants, managers, partners, members or investors, on the other hand. 6.5 Understanding of Covenants . The Executive represents that he (i) is familiar with and has carefully considered the foregoing covenants set forth in this Section 6 (together , the “ Restrictive Covenants ”), (ii) is fully aware of Executive’ s obligations hereunder , (iii) agrees to the reasonableness of the length of time, scope and geographic coverage, as applicable, of the Restrictive Covenants, (iv) agrees that the Company and its Afﬁliates currently conduct business throughout the continental United States and the rest of the world, (v) agrees that the Restrictive Covenants are necessary to protect the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ conﬁdential and proprietary information, good will, stable workforce, and customer relations, and (vi) agrees that the Restrictive Covenants will continue in ef fect for the applicable periods set forth above in this Section 6 regardless of whether the Executive is then entitled to receive severance pay or beneﬁts from the Company . The Executive understands that the Restrictive Covenants may limit Executive’ s ability to earn a livelihood in a business similar to the Business of the Company and any of its Afﬁliates, but he nevertheless believes that he has received and will receive sufﬁcient consideration and other beneﬁts as an employee of the Company and as otherwise provided hereunder or as described in the recitals hereto to clearly justify such restrictions which, in any event (given Executive’ s education, skills and ability), the Executive does not believe would prevent Executive from otherwise earning a living. The Executive agrees that the Restrictive Covenants do not confer a beneﬁt upon the Company disproportionate to the detriment of the Executive. 6.6 Cooperation . Following the Executive’ s last day of employment by the Company and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive shall reasonably cooperate with the Company and its Afﬁliates in connection with: (a) any ongoing Company matter , internal or governmental investigation or administrative, regulatory , arbitral or judicial proceeding involving the Company and any Afﬁliates with respect to matters relating to the Executive’ s 16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 36/5116/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 37/5120employment with, or service as a member of the board of directors of, the Company or any Afﬁliate (collectively , “Litigation ”); or (b) any audit of the ﬁnancial statements of the Company or any Afﬁliate with respect to the period of time when the Executive was employed by the Company or any Afﬁliate (“ Audit ”). The Executive acknowledges that such cooperation may include, but shall not be limited to, the Executive making himself or herself available to the Company or any Afﬁliate (or their respective attorneys or auditors) upon reasonable notice for: (i) interviews, factual investigations, and providing declarations or afﬁdavits that provide truthful information in connection with any Litigation or Audit; (ii) appearing at the request of the Company or any Afﬁliate to give testimony without requiring service of a subpoena or other legal process; (iii) volunteering to the Company or any Afﬁliate pertinent information related to any Litigation or Audit; and (iv) turning over to the Company or any Afﬁliate any documents relevant to any Litigation or Audit that are or may come into the Executive’ s possession. The Company shall reimburse the Executive for reasonable travel expenses incurred in connection with providing the services under this Section 6.6, including lodging and meals, upon the Executive’ s submission of receipts. If, due to an actual or potential conﬂict of interest, it is necessary for the Executive to retain separate counsel in connection with providing the services under this Section 6.6, and such counsel is not otherwise supplied by and at the expense of the Company (pursuant to indemniﬁcation rights of the Executive or otherwise), the Company shall further reimburse the Executive for the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel. 6.7 Enfor cement . The Executive agrees that the Executive’ s services are unique and that he has access to Conﬁdential Information and Work Product. Accordingly , without limiting the generality of Section 17, the Executive agrees that a breach by the Executive of any of the covenants in this Section 6 would cause immediate and irreparable harm to the Company that would be difﬁcult or impossible to measure, and that damages to the Company for any such injury would therefore be an inadequate remedy for any such breach. Therefore, the Executive agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Section 6, the Company shall be entitled, in addition to and without limitation upon all other remedies the Company may have under this Agreement, at law or otherwise, to obtain speciﬁc performance, injunctive relief and/or other appropriate relief (without posting any bond or deposit)in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions of this Section 6. The Executive further agrees that the applicable period of time any Restrictive Covenant is in ef fect following the Severance Date, as determined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, shall be extended by the same amount of time that Executive is in breach of any Restrictive Covenant. 7. Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary , the Company may withhold (or cause there to be withheld, as the case may be) from any amounts otherwise due or payable under or pursuant to this Agreement such federal, state and local income, employment, or other taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 38/5116/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 39/51218.

The provisions of this paragraph shall only apply if, and to the extent, required to avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. For purposes of clarity , the six (6) month delay shall not apply in the case of any short-term deferral as contemplated by Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) or severance pay contemplated by Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9) (iii) to the extent of the limits set forth therein. Any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive upon or in the six (6) month period following the Executive’ s Separation from Service that are not so paid by reason of this Section 5.7(a) shall be paid (without interest) as soon as practicable (and in all events within thirty (30) days) after the date that is six (6) months after the Executive’ s Separation from Service (or , if earlier , as soon as practicable, and in all events within thirty (30) days, after the date of the Executive’ s death). (b) To the extent that any beneﬁts pursuant to Sections 5.3(b)(ii), (c)(ii) or (d)(v) or reimbursements pursuant to Section 4 are taxable to the Executive, any reimbursement payment due to the Executive pursuant to any such provision shall be paid to the Executive on or before the last day of the Executive’ s taxable year following the taxable year in which the related expense was incurred.

(c) Any installment payments provided for in this Agreement shall be treated as separate payments for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. To the extent required to avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, the deﬁnition of Change in Control will be interpreted to mean a change in the ownership, ef fective control or ownership of a substantial portion of assets of Parent within the meaning of16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 26/511416/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 27/5115Section 409A of the Code.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary , if following a change in ownership or effective control or in the ownership of a substantial portion of assets (in each case, within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code), the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any similar or successor tax (the “ Excise Tax”) applies to any payments, beneﬁts and/or amounts received by the Executive pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, including, without limitation, any acceleration of the vesting of outstanding stock options or other equity awards (collectively , the “ Total Payments ”), then the Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) so that the maximum amount of the Total Payments (after reduction) shall be one dollar ($1.00) less than the amount which would cause the Total Payments to be subject to the Excise Tax; provided that such reduction to the Total Payments shall be made only if the total after -tax beneﬁt to the Executive is greater after giving ef fect to such reduction than if no such reduction had been made. If such a reduction is required, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Total Payments by ﬁrst reducing or eliminating any cash payments under this Agreement, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of stock options, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of other equity awards, then by reducing or eliminating any other remaining Total Payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with the payments which are to be paid the farthest in time from the date of the transaction triggering the Excise Tax. The provisions of this Section 5.8 shall take precedence over the provisions of any other plan, arrangement or agreement governing the Executive’ s rights and entitlements to any beneﬁts or compensation. 6. Protective Covenants. 6.1 Conﬁdential Information; Inventions . (a) The Executive shall not disclose or use at any time, either during the Period of Employment or thereafter , any Conﬁdential Information (as deﬁned below) of which the Executive is or becomes aware, whether or not such information is developed by Executive, except to the extent that such disclosure or use is directly related to and required by the Executive’ s performance in good faith of duties for the Company . The Executive will take all appropriate steps to safeguard Conﬁdential Information in Executive’ s possession and to protect it against disclosure, misuse, espionage, loss and theft. The Executive shall deliver to the Company at the termination of the Period of Employment, or at any time the Company may request, all memoranda, notes, plans, records, reports, computer tapes and software and other documents and data (and copies thereof) relating to the Conﬁdential Information or the Work Product (as hereinafter deﬁned) of the16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 28/5116/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 29/51business of the Company or any of its Afﬁliates which the Executive may then possess or have under Executive’ s control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive may truthfully respond to a lawful and valid subpoena or other legal process, but shall give the Company the earliest possible notice thereof, shall, as much in advance of the return date as possible, make available to the Company and its counsel the documents and other information sought, and shall assist the Company and such counsel in resisting or otherwise responding to such process. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits Executive from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity , or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation. Executive does not need the prior authorization to make any such reports or disclosures and is not required to notify the Employer of such reports or disclosures. Pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, the Executive acknowledges that he may not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of conﬁdential information that: (a) is made in conﬁdence to a federal, state, or local government ofﬁcial, either directly or indirectly , or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (b) is made in a complaint or other document that is ﬁled in a lawsuit or other proceeding, provided that such ﬁling is made under seal. Further , the Executive understands that the Company will not retaliate against him in any way for any such disclosure made in accordance with the law . In the event a disclosure is made, and the Executive ﬁles any type of proceeding against the Company alleging that the Company retaliated against the Executive because of his disclosure, the Executive may disclose the relevant conﬁdential information to his attorney and may use the conﬁdential information in the proceeding if (x) the Executive ﬁles any document containing the conﬁdential information under seal, and (y) the Executive does not otherwise disclose the conﬁdential information except pursuant to court order . (b) As used in this Agreement, the term “ Conﬁdential Information ” means information that is not generally known to the public and that is used, developed or obtained by the Company or its Afﬁliates in connection with their businesses, including, but not limited to, information, observations and data obtained by the Executive while employed by the Company or any predecessors thereof (including those obtained prior to the Ef fective Date) concerning (i) the business or af fairs of the Company (or such predecessors), (ii) products or services, (iii) fees, costs and pricing structures, (iv) designs, (v) analyses, (vi) drawings, photographs and reports, (vii) computer software, including operating systems, applications and program listings, (viii) ﬂow charts, manuals and documentation, (ix) data bases, (x) accounting and business methods, (xi) inventions, devices, new developments, methods and processes, whether patentable or unpatentable and whether or not reduced to practice, (xii) customers and clients and customer or client lists, (xiii) other copyrightable works, (xiv) all production16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 30/511616/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 31/51methods, processes, technology and trade secrets, and (xv) all similar and related information in whatever form. Conﬁdential Information will not include any information that has been published (other than a disclosure by the Executive in breach of this Agreement) in a form generally available to the public prior to the date the Executive proposes to disclose or use such information. Conﬁdential Information will not be deemed to have been published merely because individual portions of the information have been separately published, but only if all material features comprising such information have been published in combination. (c) As used in this Agreement, the term “ Work Product ” means all inventions, innovations, improvements, technical information, systems, software developments, methods, designs, analyses, drawings, reports, service marks, trademarks, trade names, logos and all similar or related information (whether patentable or unpatentable, copyrightable, registerable as a trademark, reduced to writing, or otherwise) which relates to the Company’ s or any of its Afﬁliates’ actual or anticipated business, research and development or existing or future products or services and which are conceived, developed or made by the Executive (whether or not during usual business hours, whether or not by the use of the facilities of the Company or any of its Afﬁliates, and whether or not alone or in conjunction with any other person) while employed by the Company (including those conceived, developed or made prior to the Ef fective Date) together with all patent applications, letters patent, trademark, trade name and service mark applications or registrations, copyrights and reissues thereof that may be granted for or upon any of the foregoing. All Work Product that the Executive may have discovered, invented or originated during Executive’ s employment by the Company or any of its Afﬁliates prior to the Ef fective Date or that he may discover , invent or originate during the Period of Employment or at any time prior to the Severance Date, shall be the exclusive property of the Company and its Afﬁliates, as applicable, and Executive hereby assigns all of Executive’ s right, title and interest in and to such Work Product to the Company or its applicable Afﬁliate, including all intellectual property rights therein. Executive shall promptly disclose all Work Product to the Company , shall execute at the request of the Company any assignments or other documents the Company may deem necessary to protect or perfect its (or any of its Afﬁliates’, as applicable) rights therein, and shall assist the Company , at the Company’ s expense, in obtaining, defending and enforcing the Company’ s (or any of its Afﬁliates’, as applicable) rights therein. The Executive hereby appoints the Company as Executive’ s attorney-in-fact to execute on Executive’ s behalf any assignments or other documents deemed necessary by the Company to protect or perfect the Company’ s (and any of its Afﬁliates’, as applicable) rights to any Work Product. 6.2 Restriction on Competition . The Executive acknowledges that, in the course of Executive’ s employment with the Company and/or its Afﬁliates, he has 16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 32/511716/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 33/5118become familiar , or will become familiar , with the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ and their predecessors’ trade secrets and with other Conﬁdential Information concerning the Company , its Afﬁliates and their respective predecessors and that Executive’ s services have been and will be of special, unique and extraordinary value to the Company and its Afﬁliates. The Executive agrees that if the Executive were to become employed by , or substantially involved in, the business of a competitor of the Company or any of its Afﬁliates following the Severance Date, it would be very difﬁcult for the Executive not to rely on or use the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information. Thus, to avoid the inevitable disclosure of the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information, and to protect such trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information and the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ relationships and goodwill with customers, during the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person engage in, enter the employ of, render any services to, have any ownership interest in, nor participate in the ﬁnancing, operation, management or control of, any Competing Business. For purposes of this Agreement, the phrase “directly or indirectly through any other Person engage in” shall include, without limitation, any direct or indirect ownership or proﬁt participation interest in such enterprise, whether as an owner , stockholder , member , partner , joint venturer or otherwise, and shall include any direct or indirect participation in such enterprise as an employee, consultant, director , ofﬁcer , licensor of technology or otherwise. For purposes of this Agreement, “ Competing Business ” means a Person anywhere in the continental United States and elsewhere in the world where the Company and its Afﬁliates engage in business, or reasonably anticipate engaging in business, on the Severance Date (the “ Restricted Area ”) that at any time during the Period of Employment has competed, or at any time during the twelve month period following the Severance Date competes, with the Company or any of its Afﬁliates in the passenger cruise ship industry (the “ Business ”). Nothing herein shall prohibit the Executive from being a passive owner of not more than 2% of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation which is publicly traded, so long as the Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive and the Company may agree that the Company shall waive all or a portion of the non-competition restrictions provided for in this Section 6.2 in exchange for the Executive’ s agreement to forfeit all or a portion of the Severance Beneﬁt payable under Section 5.3(b), the Change in Control Severance Beneﬁt payable under Section 5.3(c) or retirement beneﬁts in Section 5.3(d). Any such agreement between the Executive and the Company shall be documented in the general release agreement provided for in Section 5.4 or in such other written agreement between the Executive and the Company determined by the Company . 6.3 Non-Solicitation of Employees and Consultants . During the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person (i) induce or attempt to induce any employee or independent contractor of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company to leave the employ or service, as applicable, of the 16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 34/5116/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 35/5119Company or such Afﬁliate, or in any way interfere with the relationship between the Company or any such Afﬁliate, on the one hand, and any employee or independent contractor thereof, on the other hand, or (ii) hire any person who was an employee of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company until twelve months after such individual’ s employment relationship with the Company or such Afﬁliate has been terminated. 6.4 Non-Solicitation of Customers . During the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person inﬂuence or attempt to inﬂuence customers, vendors, suppliers, licensors, lessors, joint venturers, associates, consultants, agents, or partners of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company to divert their business away from the Company or such Afﬁliate, and the Executive will not otherwise interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt the business relationships, contractual or otherwise, between the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company , on the one hand, and any of its or their customers, suppliers, vendors, lessors, licensors, joint venturers, associates, ofﬁcers, employees, consultants, managers, partners, members or investors, on the other hand. 6.5 Understanding of Covenants . The Executive represents that he (i) is familiar with and has carefully considered the foregoing covenants set forth in this Section 6 (together , the “ Restrictive Covenants ”), (ii) is fully aware of Executive’ s obligations hereunder , (iii) agrees to the reasonableness of the length of time, scope and geographic coverage, as applicable, of the Restrictive Covenants, (iv) agrees that the Company and its Afﬁliates currently conduct business throughout the continental United States and the rest of the world, (v) agrees that the Restrictive Covenants are necessary to protect the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ conﬁdential and proprietary information, good will, stable workforce, and customer relations, and (vi) agrees that the Restrictive Covenants will continue in ef fect for the applicable periods set forth above in this Section 6 regardless of whether the Executive is then entitled to receive severance pay or beneﬁts from the Company . The Executive understands that the Restrictive Covenants may limit Executive’ s ability to earn a livelihood in a business similar to the Business of the Company and any of its Afﬁliates, but he nevertheless believes that he has received and will receive sufﬁcient consideration and other beneﬁts as an employee of the Company and as otherwise provided hereunder or as described in the recitals hereto to clearly justify such restrictions which, in any event (given Executive’ s education, skills and ability), the Executive does not believe would prevent Executive from otherwise earning a living. The Executive agrees that the Restrictive Covenants do not confer a beneﬁt upon the Company disproportionate to the detriment of the Executive. 6.6 Cooperation . Following the Executive’ s last day of employment by the Company and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive shall reasonably cooperate with the Company and its Afﬁliates in connection with: (a) any ongoing Company matter , internal or governmental investigation or administrative, regulatory , arbitral or judicial proceeding involving the Company and any Afﬁliates with respect to matters relating to the Executive’ s 16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 36/5116/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 37/5120employment with, or service as a member of the board of directors of, the Company or any Afﬁliate (collectively , “Litigation ”); or (b) any audit of the ﬁnancial statements of the Company or any Afﬁliate with respect to the period of time when the Executive was employed by the Company or any Afﬁliate (“ Audit ”). The Executive acknowledges that such cooperation may include, but shall not be limited to, the Executive making himself or herself available to the Company or any Afﬁliate (or their respective attorneys or auditors) upon reasonable notice for: (i) interviews, factual investigations, and providing declarations or afﬁdavits that provide truthful information in connection with any Litigation or Audit; (ii) appearing at the request of the Company or any Afﬁliate to give testimony without requiring service of a subpoena or other legal process; (iii) volunteering to the Company or any Afﬁliate pertinent information related to any Litigation or Audit; and (iv) turning over to the Company or any Afﬁliate any documents relevant to any Litigation or Audit that are or may come into the Executive’ s possession. The Company shall reimburse the Executive for reasonable travel expenses incurred in connection with providing the services under this Section 6.6, including lodging and meals, upon the Executive’ s submission of receipts. If, due to an actual or potential conﬂict of interest, it is necessary for the Executive to retain separate counsel in connection with providing the services under this Section 6.6, and such counsel is not otherwise supplied by and at the expense of the Company (pursuant to indemniﬁcation rights of the Executive or otherwise), the Company shall further reimburse the Executive for the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel. 6.7 Enfor cement . The Executive agrees that the Executive’ s services are unique and that he has access to Conﬁdential Information and Work Product. Accordingly , without limiting the generality of Section 17, the Executive agrees that a breach by the Executive of any of the covenants in this Section 6 would cause immediate and irreparable harm to the Company that would be difﬁcult or impossible to measure, and that damages to the Company for any such injury would therefore be an inadequate remedy for any such breach. Therefore, the Executive agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Section 6, the Company shall be entitled, in addition to and without limitation upon all other remedies the Company may have under this Agreement, at law or otherwise, to obtain speciﬁc performance, injunctive relief and/or other appropriate relief (without posting any bond or deposit)in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions of this Section 6. The Executive further agrees that the applicable period of time any Restrictive Covenant is in ef fect following the Severance Date, as determined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, shall be extended by the same amount of time that Executive is in breach of any Restrictive Covenant. 7. Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary , the Company may withhold (or cause there to be withheld, as the case may be) from any amounts otherwise due or payable under or pursuant to this Agreement such federal, state and local income, employment, or other taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 38/5116/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030301 39/51218.

To the extent required to avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, the deﬁnition of Change in Control will be interpreted to mean a change in the ownership, ef fective control or ownership of a substantial portion of assets of Parent within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. This Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A and 457A of the Code and shall be interpreted consistent with this intent so as to avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A and 457A of the Code. 5.8 Possible Limitation of Beneﬁts in Connection with a Change in Contr ol. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary , if following a change in ownership or effective control or in the ownership of a substantial portion of assets (in each case, within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code), the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any similar or successor tax (the “ Excise Tax”) applies to any payments, beneﬁts and/or amounts received by the Executive pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, including, without limitation, any acceleration of the vesting of outstanding stock options or other equity awards (collectively , the “ Total Payments ”), then the Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) so that the maximum amount of the Total Payments (after reduction) shall be one dollar ($1.00) less than the amount which would cause the Total Payments to be subject to the Excise Tax; provided that such reduction to the Total Payments shall be made only if the total after - tax beneﬁt to the Executive is greater after giving ef fect to such reduction16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 27/541416/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 28/54than if no such reduction had been made. If such a reduction is required, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Total Payments by ﬁrst reducing or eliminating any cash payments under this Agreement, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of stock options, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of other equity awards, then by reducing or eliminating any other remaining Total Payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with the payments which are to be paid the farthest in time from the date of the transaction triggering the Excise Tax. The provisions of this Section 5.8 shall take precedence over the provisions of any other plan, arrangement or agreement governing the Executive’ s rights and entitlements to any beneﬁts or compensation. 6. Protective Covenants. 6.1 Conﬁdential Information; Inventions . (a) The Executive shall not disclose or use at any time, either during the Period of Employment or thereafter , any Conﬁdential Information (as deﬁned below) of which the Executive is or becomes aware, whether or not such information is developed by Executive, except to the extent that such disclosure or use is directly related to and required by the Executive’ s performance in good faith of duties for the Company . The Executive will take all appropriate steps to safeguard Conﬁdential Information in Executive’ s possession and to protect it against disclosure, misuse, espionage, loss and theft. The Executive shall deliver to the Company at the termination of the Period of Employment, or at any time the Company may request, all memoranda, notes, plans, records, reports, computer tapes and software and other documents and data (and copies thereof) relating to the Conﬁdential Information or the Work Product (as hereinafter deﬁned) of the business of the Company or any of its Afﬁliates which the Executive may then possess or have under Executive’ s control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive may truthfully respond to a lawful and valid subpoena or other legal process, but shall give the Company the earliest possible notice thereof, shall, as much in advance of the return date as possible, make available to the Company and its counsel the documents and other information sought, and shall assist the Company and such counsel in resisting or otherwise responding to such process. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits Executive from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity , or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation. Executive does not need the prior authorization to make any such reports or disclosures and is not required to notify the Employer of such reports or disclosures. Pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, the Executive acknowledges that he may not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of conﬁdential information that: (a) is made in conﬁdence to a federal, state, or local16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 29/541516/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 30/54government ofﬁcial, either directly or indirectly , or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (b) is made in a complaint or other document that is ﬁled in a lawsuit or other proceeding, provided that such ﬁling is made under seal. Further , the Executive understands that the Company will not retaliate against him in any way for any such disclosure made in accordance with the law . In the event a disclosure is made, and the Executive ﬁles any type of proceeding against the Company alleging that the Company retaliated against the Executive because of his disclosure, the Executive may disclose the relevant conﬁdential information to his attorney and may use the conﬁdential information in the proceeding if (x) the Executive ﬁles any document containing the conﬁdential information under seal, and (y) the Executive does not otherwise disclose the conﬁdential information except pursuant to court order . (b) As used in this Agreement, the term “ Conﬁdential Information ” means information that is not generally known to the public and that is used, developed or obtained by the Company or its Afﬁliates in connection with their businesses, including, but not limited to, information, observations and data obtained by the Executive while employed by the Company or any predecessors thereof (including those obtained prior to the Ef fective Date) concerning (i) the business or af fairs of the Company (or such predecessors), (ii) products or services, (iii) fees, costs and pricing structures, (iv) designs, (v) analyses, (vi) drawings, photographs and reports, (vii) computer software, including operating systems, applications and program listings, (viii) ﬂow charts, manuals and documentation, (ix) data bases, (x) accounting and business methods, (xi) inventions, devices, new developments, methods and processes, whether patentable or unpatentable and whether or not reduced to practice, (xii) customers and clients and customer or client lists, (xiii) other copyrightable works, (xiv) all production methods, processes, technology and trade secrets, and (xv) all similar and related information in whatever form. Conﬁdential Information will not include any information that has been published (other than a disclosure by the Executive in breach of this Agreement) in a form generally available to the public prior to the date the Executive proposes to disclose or use such information. Conﬁdential Information will not be deemed to have been published merely because individual portions of the information have been separately published, but only if all material features comprising such information have been published in combination. (c) As used in this Agreement, the term “ Work Product ” means all inventions, innovations, improvements, technical information, systems, software developments, methods, designs, analyses, drawings, reports, service marks, trademarks, trade names, logos and all similar or related information (whether patentable or unpatentable, copyrightable, registerable as a trademark, reduced to writing, or otherwise) which relates16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 31/541616/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 32/54to the Company’ s or any of its Afﬁliates’ actual or anticipated business, research and development or existing or future products or services and which are conceived, developed or made by the Executive (whether or not during usual business hours, whether or not by the use of the facilities of the Company or any of its Afﬁliates, and whether or not alone or in conjunction with any other person) while employed by the Company (including those conceived, developed or made prior to the Ef fective Date) together with all patent applications, letters patent, trademark, trade name and service mark applications or registrations, copyrights and reissues thereof that may be granted for or upon any of the foregoing. All Work Product that the Executive may have discovered, invented or originated during Executive’ s employment by the Company or any of its Afﬁliates prior to the Ef fective Date or that he may discover , invent or originate during the Period of Employment or at any time prior to the Severance Date, shall be the exclusive property of the Company and its Afﬁliates, as applicable, and Executive hereby assigns all of Executive’ s right, title and interest in and to such Work Product to the Company or its applicable Afﬁliate, including all intellectual property rights therein. Executive shall promptly disclose all Work Product to the Company , shall execute at the request of the Company any assignments or other documents the Company may deem necessary to protect or perfect its (or any of its Afﬁliates’, as applicable) rights therein, and shall assist the Company , at the Company’ s expense, in obtaining, defending and enforcing the Company’ s (or any of its Afﬁliates’, as applicable) rights therein. The Executive hereby appoints the Company as Executive’ s attorney-in-fact to execute on Executive’ s behalf any assignments or other documents deemed necessary by the Company to protect or perfect the Company’ s (and any of its Afﬁliates’, as applicable) rights to any Work Product. 6.2 Restriction on Competition . The Executive acknowledges that, in the course of Executive’ s employment with the Company and/or its Afﬁliates, he has become familiar , or will become familiar , with the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ and their predecessors’ trade secrets and with other Conﬁdential Information concerning the Company , its Afﬁliates and their respective predecessors and that Executive’ s services have been and will be of special, unique and extraordinary value to the Company and its Afﬁliates. The Executive agrees that if the Executive were to become employed by , or substantially involved in, the business of a competitor of the Company or any of its Afﬁliates following the Severance Date, it would be very difﬁcult for the Executive not to rely on or use the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information. Thus, to avoid the inevitable disclosure of the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information, and to protect such trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information and the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ relationships and goodwill with customers, during the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person engage in, enter the employ of, render any services to, have any ownership interest in, nor participate in the ﬁnancing, operation, 16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 33/541716/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 34/5418management or control of, any Competing Business. For purposes of this Agreement, the phrase “directly or indirectly through any other Person engage in” shall include, without limitation, any direct or indirect ownership or proﬁt participation interest in such enterprise, whether as an owner , stockholder , member , partner , joint venturer or otherwise, and shall include any direct or indirect participation in such enterprise as an employee, consultant, director , ofﬁcer , licensor of technology or otherwise. For purposes of this Agreement, “Competing Business ” means a Person anywhere in the continental United States and elsewhere in the world where the Company and its Afﬁliates engage in business, or reasonably anticipate engaging in business, on the Severance Date (the “ Restricted Area ”) that at any time during the Period of Employment has competed, or at any time during the twelve month period following the Severance Date competes, with the Company or any of its Afﬁliates in the passenger cruise ship industry (the “ Business ”). Nothing herein shall prohibit the Executive from being a passive owner of not more than 2% of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation which is publicly traded, so long as the Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive and the Company may agree that the Company shall waive all or a portion of the non-competition restrictions provided for in this Section 6.2 in exchange for the Executive’ s agreement to forfeit all or a portion of the Severance Beneﬁt payable under Section 5.3(b), the Change in Control Severance Beneﬁt payable under Section 5.3(c) or retirement beneﬁts in Section 5.3(d). Any such agreement between the Executive and the Company shall be documented in the general release agreement provided for in Section 5.4 or in such other written agreement between the Executive and the Company determined by the Company . 6.3 Non-Solicitation of Employees and Consultants . During the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person (i) induce or attempt to induce any employee or independent contractor of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company to leave the employ or service, as applicable, of the Company or such Afﬁliate, or in any way interfere with the relationship between the Company or any such Afﬁliate, on the one hand, and any employee or independent contractor thereof, on the other hand, or (ii) hire any person who was an employee of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company until twelve months after such individual’ s employment relationship with the Company or such Afﬁliate has been terminated. 6.4 Non-Solicitation of Customers . During the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person inﬂuence or attempt to inﬂuence customers, vendors, suppliers, licensors, lessors, joint venturers, associates, consultants, agents, or partners of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company to divert their business away from the Company or such Afﬁliate, and the Executive will not otherwise interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt the business relationships, contractual or otherwise, between the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company , on the one hand, and any of its or their customers, 16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 35/5416/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 36/5419suppliers, vendors, lessors, licensors, joint venturers, associates, ofﬁcers, employees, consultants, managers, partners, members or investors, on the other hand. 6.5 Understanding of Covenants . The Executive represents that he (i) is familiar with and has carefully considered the foregoing covenants set forth in this Section 6 (together , the “ Restrictive Covenants ”), (ii) is fully aware of Executive’ s obligations hereunder , (iii) agrees to the reasonableness of the length of time, scope and geographic coverage, as applicable, of the Restrictive Covenants, (iv) agrees that the Company and its Afﬁliates currently conduct business throughout the continental United States and the rest of the world, (v) agrees that the Restrictive Covenants are necessary to protect the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ conﬁdential and proprietary information, good will, stable workforce, and customer relations, and (vi) agrees that the Restrictive Covenants will continue in ef fect for the applicable periods set forth above in this Section 6 regardless of whether the Executive is then entitled to receive severance pay or beneﬁts from the Company . The Executive understands that the Restrictive Covenants may limit Executive’ s ability to earn a livelihood in a business similar to the Business of the Company and any of its Afﬁliates, but he nevertheless believes that he has received and will receive sufﬁcient consideration and other beneﬁts as an employee of the Company and as otherwise provided hereunder or as described in the recitals hereto to clearly justify such restrictions which, in any event (given Executive’ s education, skills and ability), the Executive does not believe would prevent Executive from otherwise earning a living. The Executive agrees that the Restrictive Covenants do not confer a beneﬁt upon the Company disproportionate to the detriment of the Executive. 6.6 Cooperation . Following the Executive’ s last day of employment by the Company , the Executive shall reasonably cooperate with the Company and its Afﬁliates in connection with: (a) any ongoing Company matter , internal or governmental investigation or administrative, regulatory , arbitral or judicial proceeding involving the Company and any Afﬁliates with respect to matters relating to the Executive’ s employment with, or service as a member of the board of directors of, the Company or any Afﬁliate (collectively , “Litigation”); or (b) any audit of the ﬁnancial statements of the Company or any Afﬁliate with respect to the period of time when the Executive was employed by the Company or any Afﬁliate (“ Audit ”). The Executive acknowledges that such cooperation may include, but shall not be limited to, the Executive making himself or herself available to the Company or any Afﬁliate (or their respective attorneys or auditors) upon reasonable notice for: (i) interviews, factual investigations, and providing declarations or afﬁdavits that provide truthful information in connection with any Litigation or Audit; (ii) appearing at the request of the Company or any Afﬁliate to give testimony without requiring service of a subpoena or other legal process; (iii) volunteering to the Company or any Afﬁliate pertinent information related to any Litigation or Audit; and (iv) turning over to the Company or any Afﬁliate any documents relevant to any Litigation or Audit that are or may come into the Executive’ s possession. The Company shall 16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 37/5416/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 38/5420reimburse the Executive for reasonable travel expenses incurred in connection with providing the services under this Section 6.6, including lodging and meals, upon the Executive’ s submission of receipts. If, due to an actual or potential conﬂict of interest, it is necessary for the Executive to retain separate counsel in connection with providing the services under this Section 6.6, and such counsel is not otherwise supplied by and at the expense of the Company (pursuant to indemniﬁcation rights of the Executive or otherwise), the Company shall further reimburse the Executive for the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel. 6.7 Enfor cement . The Executive agrees that the Executive’ s services are unique and that he has access to Conﬁdential Information and Work Product. Accordingly , without limiting the generality of Section 17, the Executive agrees that a breach by the Executive of any of the covenants in this Section 6 would cause immediate and irreparable harm to the Company that would be difﬁcult or impossible to measure, and that damages to the Company for any such injury would therefore be an inadequate remedy for any such breach. Therefore, the Executive agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Section 6, the Company shall be entitled, in addition to and without limitation upon all other remedies the Company may have under this Agreement, at law or otherwise, to obtain speciﬁc performance, injunctive relief and/or other appropriate relief (without posting any bond or deposit) in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions of this Section 6. The Executive further agrees that the applicable period of time any Restrictive Covenant is in ef fect following the Severance Date, as determined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, shall be extended by the same amount of time that Executive is in breach of any Restrictive Covenant. 7. Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary , the Company may withhold (or cause there to be withheld, as the case may be) from any amounts otherwise due or payable under or pursuant to this Agreement such federal, state and local income, employment, or other taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. 8. Successors and Assigns . (a) This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the beneﬁt of and be enforceable by the Executive’ s legal representatives. (b) This Agreement shall inure to the beneﬁt of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, mer ger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 39/5416/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 40/5421Company to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.

Number and Gender; Examples . Where the context requires, the singular shall include the plural, the plural shall include the singular , and any gender shall include all other genders.

Severability . It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Accordingly , if any particular provision of this Agreement shall be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable under any present or future law , and if the rights and obligations of any party under this Agreement will not be materially and adversely af fected thereby , such provision, as to such jurisdiction, shall be inef fective, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or af fecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of this Agreement are declared to be severable; furthermore, in lieu of such invalid or unenforceable provision there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement, a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn (as to geographic scope, period of duration or otherwise) so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or af fecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.16/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 41/5416/04/2025, 06:34 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1030302 42/542213.

If such a reduction is required, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Total Payments by ﬁrst reducing or eliminating any cash payments under this Agreement, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of stock options, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of other equity awards, then by reducing or eliminating any other remaining Total Payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with the payments which are to be paid the farthest in time from the date of the transaction triggering the Excise Tax. The provisions of this Section 5.8 shall take precedence over the provisions of any other plan, arrangement or agreement governing the Executive’ s rights and entitlements to any beneﬁts or compensation. 6. Protective Covenants. 6.1 Conﬁdential Information; Inventions . (a) The Executive shall not disclose or use at any time, either during the Period of Employment or thereafter , any Conﬁdential Information (as deﬁned below) of which the Executive is or becomes aware, whether or not such information is developed by Executive, except to the extent that such disclosure or use is directly related to and required by the Executive’ s performance in good faith of duties for the Company . The Executive will take all appropriate steps to safeguard Conﬁdential Information in Executive’ s possession and to protect it against disclosure, misuse, espionage, loss and theft. The Executive shall deliver to the Company at the termination of the Period of Employment, or at any time the Company may request, all memoranda, notes, plans, records, reports, computer tapes and software and other documents and data (and copies thereof) relating to the Conﬁdential Information or the Work Product (as hereinafter deﬁned) of the16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 28/5116/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 29/51business of the Company or any of its Afﬁliates which the Executive may then possess or have under Executive’ s control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive may truthfully respond to a lawful and valid subpoena or other legal process, but shall give the Company the earliest possible notice thereof, shall, as much in advance of the return date as possible, make available to the Company and its counsel the documents and other information sought, and shall assist the Company and such counsel in resisting or otherwise responding to such process. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits Executive from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity , or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation. Executive does not need the prior authorization to make any such reports or disclosures and is not required to notify the Employer of such reports or disclosures. Pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, the Executive acknowledges that he may not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of conﬁdential information that: (a) is made in conﬁdence to a federal, state, or local government ofﬁcial, either directly or indirectly , or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (b) is made in a complaint or other document that is ﬁled in a lawsuit or other proceeding, provided that such ﬁling is made under seal. Further , the Executive understands that the Company will not retaliate against him in any way for any such disclosure made in accordance with the law . In the event a disclosure is made, and the Executive ﬁles any type of proceeding against the Company alleging that the Company retaliated against the Executive because of his disclosure, the Executive may disclose the relevant conﬁdential information to his attorney and may use the conﬁdential information in the proceeding if (x) the Executive ﬁles any document containing the conﬁdential information under seal, and (y) the Executive does not otherwise disclose the conﬁdential information except pursuant to court order . (b) As used in this Agreement, the term “ Conﬁdential Information ” means information that is not generally known to the public and that is used, developed or obtained by the Company or its Afﬁliates in connection with their businesses, including, but not limited to, information, observations and data obtained by the Executive while employed by the Company or any predecessors thereof (including those obtained prior to the Ef fective Date) concerning (i) the business or af fairs of the Company (or such predecessors), (ii) products or services, (iii) fees, costs and pricing structures, (iv) designs, (v) analyses, (vi) drawings, photographs and reports, (vii) computer software, including operating systems, applications and program listings, (viii) ﬂow charts, manuals and documentation, (ix) data bases, (x) accounting and business methods, (xi) inventions, devices, new developments, methods and processes, whether patentable or unpatentable and whether or not reduced to practice, (xii) customers and clients and customer or client lists, (xiii) other copyrightable works, (xiv) all production16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 30/511616/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 31/51methods, processes, technology and trade secrets, and (xv) all similar and related information in whatever form. Conﬁdential Information will not include any information that has been published (other than a disclosure by the Executive in breach of this Agreement) in a form generally available to the public prior to the date the Executive proposes to disclose or use such information. Conﬁdential Information will not be deemed to have been published merely because individual portions of the information have been separately published, but only if all material features comprising such information have been published in combination. (c) As used in this Agreement, the term “ Work Product ” means all inventions, innovations, improvements, technical information, systems, software developments, methods, designs, analyses, drawings, reports, service marks, trademarks, trade names, logos and all similar or related information (whether patentable or unpatentable, copyrightable, registerable as a trademark, reduced to writing, or otherwise) which relates to the Company’ s or any of its Afﬁliates’ actual or anticipated business, research and development or existing or future products or services and which are conceived, developed or made by the Executive (whether or not during usual business hours, whether or not by the use of the facilities of the Company or any of its Afﬁliates, and whether or not alone or in conjunction with any other person) while employed by the Company (including those conceived, developed or made prior to the Ef fective Date) together with all patent applications, letters patent, trademark, trade name and service mark applications or registrations, copyrights and reissues thereof that may be granted for or upon any of the foregoing. All Work Product that the Executive may have discovered, invented or originated during Executive’ s employment by the Company or any of its Afﬁliates prior to the Ef fective Date or that he may discover , invent or originate during the Period of Employment or at any time prior to the Severance Date, shall be the exclusive property of the Company and its Afﬁliates, as applicable, and Executive hereby assigns all of Executive’ s right, title and interest in and to such Work Product to the Company or its applicable Afﬁliate, including all intellectual property rights therein. Executive shall promptly disclose all Work Product to the Company , shall execute at the request of the Company any assignments or other documents the Company may deem necessary to protect or perfect its (or any of its Afﬁliates’, as applicable) rights therein, and shall assist the Company , at the Company’ s expense, in obtaining, defending and enforcing the Company’ s (or any of its Afﬁliates’, as applicable) rights therein. The Executive hereby appoints the Company as Executive’ s attorney-in-fact to execute on Executive’ s behalf any assignments or other documents deemed necessary by the Company to protect or perfect the Company’ s (and any of its Afﬁliates’, as applicable) rights to any Work Product. 6.2 Restriction on Competition . The Executive acknowledges that, in the course of Executive’ s employment with the Company and/or its Afﬁliates, he has 16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 32/511716/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 33/5118become familiar , or will become familiar , with the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ and their predecessors’ trade secrets and with other Conﬁdential Information concerning the Company , its Afﬁliates and their respective predecessors and that Executive’ s services have been and will be of special, unique and extraordinary value to the Company and its Afﬁliates. The Executive agrees that if the Executive were to become employed by , or substantially involved in, the business of a competitor of the Company or any of its Afﬁliates following the Severance Date, it would be very difﬁcult for the Executive not to rely on or use the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information. Thus, to avoid the inevitable disclosure of the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information, and to protect such trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information and the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ relationships and goodwill with customers, during the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person engage in, enter the employ of, render any services to, have any ownership interest in, nor participate in the ﬁnancing, operation, management or control of, any Competing Business. For purposes of this Agreement, the phrase “directly or indirectly through any other Person engage in” shall include, without limitation, any direct or indirect ownership or proﬁt participation interest in such enterprise, whether as an owner , stockholder , member , partner , joint venturer or otherwise, and shall include any direct or indirect participation in such enterprise as an employee, consultant, director , ofﬁcer , licensor of technology or otherwise. For purposes of this Agreement, “ Competing Business ” means a Person anywhere in the continental United States and elsewhere in the world where the Company and its Afﬁliates engage in business, or reasonably anticipate engaging in business, on the Severance Date (the “ Restricted Area ”) that at any time during the Period of Employment has competed, or at any time during the twelve month period following the Severance Date competes, with the Company or any of its Afﬁliates in the passenger cruise ship industry (the “ Business ”). Nothing herein shall prohibit the Executive from being a passive owner of not more than 2% of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation which is publicly traded, so long as the Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive and the Company may agree that the Company shall waive all or a portion of the non-competition restrictions provided for in this Section 6.2 in exchange for the Executive’ s agreement to forfeit all or a portion of the Severance Beneﬁt payable under Section 5.3(b), the Change in Control Severance Beneﬁt payable under Section 5.3(c) or retirement beneﬁts in Section 5.3(d). Any such agreement between the Executive and the Company shall be documented in the general release agreement provided for in Section 5.4 or in such other written agreement between the Executive and the Company determined by the Company . 6.3 Non-Solicitation of Employees and Consultants . During the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person (i) induce or attempt to induce any employee or independent contractor of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company to leave the employ or service, as applicable, of the 16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 34/5116/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 35/5119Company or such Afﬁliate, or in any way interfere with the relationship between the Company or any such Afﬁliate, on the one hand, and any employee or independent contractor thereof, on the other hand, or (ii) hire any person who was an employee of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company until twelve months after such individual’ s employment relationship with the Company or such Afﬁliate has been terminated. 6.4 Non-Solicitation of Customers . During the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person inﬂuence or attempt to inﬂuence customers, vendors, suppliers, licensors, lessors, joint venturers, associates, consultants, agents, or partners of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company to divert their business away from the Company or such Afﬁliate, and the Executive will not otherwise interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt the business relationships, contractual or otherwise, between the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company , on the one hand, and any of its or their customers, suppliers, vendors, lessors, licensors, joint venturers, associates, ofﬁcers, employees, consultants, managers, partners, members or investors, on the other hand. 6.5 Understanding of Covenants . The Executive represents that he (i) is familiar with and has carefully considered the foregoing covenants set forth in this Section 6 (together , the “ Restrictive Covenants ”), (ii) is fully aware of Executive’ s obligations hereunder , (iii) agrees to the reasonableness of the length of time, scope and geographic coverage, as applicable, of the Restrictive Covenants, (iv) agrees that the Company and its Afﬁliates currently conduct business throughout the continental United States and the rest of the world, (v) agrees that the Restrictive Covenants are necessary to protect the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ conﬁdential and proprietary information, good will, stable workforce, and customer relations, and (vi) agrees that the Restrictive Covenants will continue in ef fect for the applicable periods set forth above in this Section 6 regardless of whether the Executive is then entitled to receive severance pay or beneﬁts from the Company . The Executive understands that the Restrictive Covenants may limit Executive’ s ability to earn a livelihood in a business similar to the Business of the Company and any of its Afﬁliates, but he nevertheless believes that he has received and will receive sufﬁcient consideration and other beneﬁts as an employee of the Company and as otherwise provided hereunder or as described in the recitals hereto to clearly justify such restrictions which, in any event (given Executive’ s education, skills and ability), the Executive does not believe would prevent Executive from otherwise earning a living. The Executive agrees that the Restrictive Covenants do not confer a beneﬁt upon the Company disproportionate to the detriment of the Executive. 6.6 Cooperation . Following the Executive’ s last day of employment by the Company and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive shall reasonably cooperate with the Company and its Afﬁliates in connection with: (a) any ongoing Company matter , internal or governmental investigation or administrative, regulatory , arbitral or judicial proceeding involving the Company and any Afﬁliates with respect to matters relating to the Executive’ s 16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 36/5116/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 37/5120employment with, or service as a member of the board of directors of, the Company or any Afﬁliate (collectively , “Litigation ”); or (b) any audit of the ﬁnancial statements of the Company or any Afﬁliate with respect to the period of time when the Executive was employed by the Company or any Afﬁliate (“ Audit ”). The Executive acknowledges that such cooperation may include, but shall not be limited to, the Executive making himself or herself available to the Company or any Afﬁliate (or their respective attorneys or auditors) upon reasonable notice for: (i) interviews, factual investigations, and providing declarations or afﬁdavits that provide truthful information in connection with any Litigation or Audit; (ii) appearing at the request of the Company or any Afﬁliate to give testimony without requiring service of a subpoena or other legal process; (iii) volunteering to the Company or any Afﬁliate pertinent information related to any Litigation or Audit; and (iv) turning over to the Company or any Afﬁliate any documents relevant to any Litigation or Audit that are or may come into the Executive’ s possession. The Company shall reimburse the Executive for reasonable travel expenses incurred in connection with providing the services under this Section 6.6, including lodging and meals, upon the Executive’ s submission of receipts. If, due to an actual or potential conﬂict of interest, it is necessary for the Executive to retain separate counsel in connection with providing the services under this Section 6.6, and such counsel is not otherwise supplied by and at the expense of the Company (pursuant to indemniﬁcation rights of the Executive or otherwise), the Company shall further reimburse the Executive for the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel. 6.7 Enfor cement . The Executive agrees that the Executive’ s services are unique and that he has access to Conﬁdential Information and Work Product. Accordingly , without limiting the generality of Section 17, the Executive agrees that a breach by the Executive of any of the covenants in this Section 6 would cause immediate and irreparable harm to the Company that would be difﬁcult or impossible to measure, and that damages to the Company for any such injury would therefore be an inadequate remedy for any such breach. Therefore, the Executive agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Section 6, the Company shall be entitled, in addition to and without limitation upon all other remedies the Company may have under this Agreement, at law or otherwise, to obtain speciﬁc performance, injunctive relief and/or other appropriate relief (without posting any bond or deposit)in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions of this Section 6. The Executive further agrees that the applicable period of time any Restrictive Covenant is in ef fect following the Severance Date, as determined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, shall be extended by the same amount of time that Executive is in breach of any Restrictive Covenant. 7. Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary , the Company may withhold (or cause there to be withheld, as the case may be) from any amounts otherwise due or payable under or pursuant to this Agreement such federal, state and local income, employment, or other taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 38/5116/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 39/51218.

The Executive agrees that if the Executive were to become employed by , or substantially involved in, the business of a competitor of the Company or any of its Afﬁliates following the Severance Date, it would be very difﬁcult for the Executive not to rely on or use the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information. Thus, to avoid the inevitable disclosure of the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information, and to protect such trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information and the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ relationships and goodwill with customers, during the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person engage in, enter the employ of, render any services to, have any ownership interest in, nor participate in the ﬁnancing, operation, management or control of, any Competing Business. For purposes of this Agreement, the phrase “directly or indirectly through any other Person engage in” shall include, without limitation, any direct or indirect ownership or proﬁt participation interest in such enterprise, whether as an owner , stockholder , member , partner , joint venturer or otherwise, and shall include any direct or indirect participation in such enterprise as an employee, consultant, director , ofﬁcer , licensor of technology or otherwise. For purposes of this Agreement, “ Competing Business ” means a Person anywhere in the continental United States and elsewhere in the world where the Company and its Afﬁliates engage in business, or reasonably anticipate engaging in business, on the Severance Date (the “ Restricted Area ”) that at any time during the Period of Employment has competed, or at any time during the twelve month period following the Severance Date competes, with the Company or any of its Afﬁliates in the passenger cruise ship industry (the “ Business ”). Nothing herein shall prohibit the Executive from being a passive owner of not more than 2% of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation which is publicly traded, so long as the Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive and the Company may agree that the Company shall waive all or a portion of the non-competition restrictions provided for in this Section 6.2 in exchange for the Executive’ s agreement to forfeit all or a portion of the Severance Beneﬁt payable under Section 5.3(b), the Change in Control Severance Beneﬁt payable under Section 5.3(c) or retirement beneﬁts in Section 5.3(d). Any such agreement between the Executive and the Company shall be documented in the general release agreement provided for in Section 5.4 or in such other written agreement between the Executive and the Company determined by the Company . 6.3 Non-Solicitation of Employees and Consultants . During the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person (i) induce or attempt to induce any employee or independent contractor of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company to leave the employ or service, as applicable, of the 16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 34/5116/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 35/5119Company or such Afﬁliate, or in any way interfere with the relationship between the Company or any such Afﬁliate, on the one hand, and any employee or independent contractor thereof, on the other hand, or (ii) hire any person who was an employee of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company until twelve months after such individual’ s employment relationship with the Company or such Afﬁliate has been terminated. 6.4 Non-Solicitation of Customers . During the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person inﬂuence or attempt to inﬂuence customers, vendors, suppliers, licensors, lessors, joint venturers, associates, consultants, agents, or partners of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company to divert their business away from the Company or such Afﬁliate, and the Executive will not otherwise interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt the business relationships, contractual or otherwise, between the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company , on the one hand, and any of its or their customers, suppliers, vendors, lessors, licensors, joint venturers, associates, ofﬁcers, employees, consultants, managers, partners, members or investors, on the other hand. 6.5 Understanding of Covenants . The Executive represents that he (i) is familiar with and has carefully considered the foregoing covenants set forth in this Section 6 (together , the “ Restrictive Covenants ”), (ii) is fully aware of Executive’ s obligations hereunder , (iii) agrees to the reasonableness of the length of time, scope and geographic coverage, as applicable, of the Restrictive Covenants, (iv) agrees that the Company and its Afﬁliates currently conduct business throughout the continental United States and the rest of the world, (v) agrees that the Restrictive Covenants are necessary to protect the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ conﬁdential and proprietary information, good will, stable workforce, and customer relations, and (vi) agrees that the Restrictive Covenants will continue in ef fect for the applicable periods set forth above in this Section 6 regardless of whether the Executive is then entitled to receive severance pay or beneﬁts from the Company . The Executive understands that the Restrictive Covenants may limit Executive’ s ability to earn a livelihood in a business similar to the Business of the Company and any of its Afﬁliates, but he nevertheless believes that he has received and will receive sufﬁcient consideration and other beneﬁts as an employee of the Company and as otherwise provided hereunder or as described in the recitals hereto to clearly justify such restrictions which, in any event (given Executive’ s education, skills and ability), the Executive does not believe would prevent Executive from otherwise earning a living. The Executive agrees that the Restrictive Covenants do not confer a beneﬁt upon the Company disproportionate to the detriment of the Executive. 6.6 Cooperation . Following the Executive’ s last day of employment by the Company and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive shall reasonably cooperate with the Company and its Afﬁliates in connection with: (a) any ongoing Company matter , internal or governmental investigation or administrative, regulatory , arbitral or judicial proceeding involving the Company and any Afﬁliates with respect to matters relating to the Executive’ s 16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 36/5116/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 37/5120employment with, or service as a member of the board of directors of, the Company or any Afﬁliate (collectively , “Litigation ”); or (b) any audit of the ﬁnancial statements of the Company or any Afﬁliate with respect to the period of time when the Executive was employed by the Company or any Afﬁliate (“ Audit ”). The Executive acknowledges that such cooperation may include, but shall not be limited to, the Executive making himself or herself available to the Company or any Afﬁliate (or their respective attorneys or auditors) upon reasonable notice for: (i) interviews, factual investigations, and providing declarations or afﬁdavits that provide truthful information in connection with any Litigation or Audit; (ii) appearing at the request of the Company or any Afﬁliate to give testimony without requiring service of a subpoena or other legal process; (iii) volunteering to the Company or any Afﬁliate pertinent information related to any Litigation or Audit; and (iv) turning over to the Company or any Afﬁliate any documents relevant to any Litigation or Audit that are or may come into the Executive’ s possession. The Company shall reimburse the Executive for reasonable travel expenses incurred in connection with providing the services under this Section 6.6, including lodging and meals, upon the Executive’ s submission of receipts. If, due to an actual or potential conﬂict of interest, it is necessary for the Executive to retain separate counsel in connection with providing the services under this Section 6.6, and such counsel is not otherwise supplied by and at the expense of the Company (pursuant to indemniﬁcation rights of the Executive or otherwise), the Company shall further reimburse the Executive for the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel. 6.7 Enfor cement . The Executive agrees that the Executive’ s services are unique and that he has access to Conﬁdential Information and Work Product. Accordingly , without limiting the generality of Section 17, the Executive agrees that a breach by the Executive of any of the covenants in this Section 6 would cause immediate and irreparable harm to the Company that would be difﬁcult or impossible to measure, and that damages to the Company for any such injury would therefore be an inadequate remedy for any such breach. Therefore, the Executive agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Section 6, the Company shall be entitled, in addition to and without limitation upon all other remedies the Company may have under this Agreement, at law or otherwise, to obtain speciﬁc performance, injunctive relief and/or other appropriate relief (without posting any bond or deposit)in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions of this Section 6. The Executive further agrees that the applicable period of time any Restrictive Covenant is in ef fect following the Severance Date, as determined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, shall be extended by the same amount of time that Executive is in breach of any Restrictive Covenant. 7. Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary , the Company may withhold (or cause there to be withheld, as the case may be) from any amounts otherwise due or payable under or pursuant to this Agreement such federal, state and local income, employment, or other taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 38/5116/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031607 39/51218.

The provisions of this paragraph shall only apply if, and to the extent, required to avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. For purposes of clarity , the six (6) month delay shall not apply in the case of any short-term deferral as contemplated by Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b) (4) or severance16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 25/5416/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 26/54pay contemplated by Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A- 1(b)(9)(iii) to the extent of the limits set forth therein.

(c) Any installment payments provided for in this Agreement shall be treated as separate payments for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. To the extent required to avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, the deﬁnition of Change in Control will be interpreted to mean a change in the ownership, ef fective control or ownership of a substantial portion of assets of Parent within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. This Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A and 457A of the Code and shall be interpreted consistent with this intent so as to avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A and 457A of the Code. 5.8 Possible Limitation of Beneﬁts in Connection with a Change in Contr ol. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary , if following a change in ownership or effective control or in the ownership of a substantial portion of assets (in each case, within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code), the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any similar or successor tax (the “ Excise Tax”) applies to any payments, beneﬁts and/or amounts received by the Executive pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, including, without limitation, any acceleration of the vesting of outstanding stock options or other equity awards (collectively , the “ Total Payments ”), then the Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) so that the maximum amount of the Total Payments (after reduction) shall be one dollar ($1.00) less than the amount which would cause the Total Payments to be subject to the Excise Tax; provided that such reduction to the Total Payments shall be made only if the total after - tax beneﬁt to the Executive is greater after giving ef fect to such reduction16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 27/541416/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 28/54than if no such reduction had been made. If such a reduction is required, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Total Payments by ﬁrst reducing or eliminating any cash payments under this Agreement, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of stock options, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of other equity awards, then by reducing or eliminating any other remaining Total Payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with the payments which are to be paid the farthest in time from the date of the transaction triggering the Excise Tax. The provisions of this Section 5.8 shall take precedence over the provisions of any other plan, arrangement or agreement governing the Executive’ s rights and entitlements to any beneﬁts or compensation. 6. Protective Covenants. 6.1 Conﬁdential Information; Inventions . (a) The Executive shall not disclose or use at any time, either during the Period of Employment or thereafter , any Conﬁdential Information (as deﬁned below) of which the Executive is or becomes aware, whether or not such information is developed by Executive, except to the extent that such disclosure or use is directly related to and required by the Executive’ s performance in good faith of duties for the Company . The Executive will take all appropriate steps to safeguard Conﬁdential Information in Executive’ s possession and to protect it against disclosure, misuse, espionage, loss and theft. The Executive shall deliver to the Company at the termination of the Period of Employment, or at any time the Company may request, all memoranda, notes, plans, records, reports, computer tapes and software and other documents and data (and copies thereof) relating to the Conﬁdential Information or the Work Product (as hereinafter deﬁned) of the business of the Company or any of its Afﬁliates which the Executive may then possess or have under Executive’ s control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive may truthfully respond to a lawful and valid subpoena or other legal process, but shall give the Company the earliest possible notice thereof, shall, as much in advance of the return date as possible, make available to the Company and its counsel the documents and other information sought, and shall assist the Company and such counsel in resisting or otherwise responding to such process. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits Executive from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity , or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation. Executive does not need the prior authorization to make any such reports or disclosures and is not required to notify the Employer of such reports or disclosures. Pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, the Executive acknowledges that he may not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of conﬁdential information that: (a) is made in conﬁdence to a federal, state, or local16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 29/541516/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 30/54government ofﬁcial, either directly or indirectly , or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (b) is made in a complaint or other document that is ﬁled in a lawsuit or other proceeding, provided that such ﬁling is made under seal. Further , the Executive understands that the Company will not retaliate against him in any way for any such disclosure made in accordance with the law . In the event a disclosure is made, and the Executive ﬁles any type of proceeding against the Company alleging that the Company retaliated against the Executive because of his disclosure, the Executive may disclose the relevant conﬁdential information to his attorney and may use the conﬁdential information in the proceeding if (x) the Executive ﬁles any document containing the conﬁdential information under seal, and (y) the Executive does not otherwise disclose the conﬁdential information except pursuant to court order . (b) As used in this Agreement, the term “ Conﬁdential Information ” means information that is not generally known to the public and that is used, developed or obtained by the Company or its Afﬁliates in connection with their businesses, including, but not limited to, information, observations and data obtained by the Executive while employed by the Company or any predecessors thereof (including those obtained prior to the Ef fective Date) concerning (i) the business or af fairs of the Company (or such predecessors), (ii) products or services, (iii) fees, costs and pricing structures, (iv) designs, (v) analyses, (vi) drawings, photographs and reports, (vii) computer software, including operating systems, applications and program listings, (viii) ﬂow charts, manuals and documentation, (ix) data bases, (x) accounting and business methods, (xi) inventions, devices, new developments, methods and processes, whether patentable or unpatentable and whether or not reduced to practice, (xii) customers and clients and customer or client lists, (xiii) other copyrightable works, (xiv) all production methods, processes, technology and trade secrets, and (xv) all similar and related information in whatever form. Conﬁdential Information will not include any information that has been published (other than a disclosure by the Executive in breach of this Agreement) in a form generally available to the public prior to the date the Executive proposes to disclose or use such information. Conﬁdential Information will not be deemed to have been published merely because individual portions of the information have been separately published, but only if all material features comprising such information have been published in combination. (c) As used in this Agreement, the term “ Work Product ” means all inventions, innovations, improvements, technical information, systems, software developments, methods, designs, analyses, drawings, reports, service marks, trademarks, trade names, logos and all similar or related information (whether patentable or unpatentable, copyrightable, registerable as a trademark, reduced to writing, or otherwise) which relates16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 31/541616/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 32/54to the Company’ s or any of its Afﬁliates’ actual or anticipated business, research and development or existing or future products or services and which are conceived, developed or made by the Executive (whether or not during usual business hours, whether or not by the use of the facilities of the Company or any of its Afﬁliates, and whether or not alone or in conjunction with any other person) while employed by the Company (including those conceived, developed or made prior to the Ef fective Date) together with all patent applications, letters patent, trademark, trade name and service mark applications or registrations, copyrights and reissues thereof that may be granted for or upon any of the foregoing. All Work Product that the Executive may have discovered, invented or originated during Executive’ s employment by the Company or any of its Afﬁliates prior to the Ef fective Date or that he may discover , invent or originate during the Period of Employment or at any time prior to the Severance Date, shall be the exclusive property of the Company and its Afﬁliates, as applicable, and Executive hereby assigns all of Executive’ s right, title and interest in and to such Work Product to the Company or its applicable Afﬁliate, including all intellectual property rights therein. Executive shall promptly disclose all Work Product to the Company , shall execute at the request of the Company any assignments or other documents the Company may deem necessary to protect or perfect its (or any of its Afﬁliates’, as applicable) rights therein, and shall assist the Company , at the Company’ s expense, in obtaining, defending and enforcing the Company’ s (or any of its Afﬁliates’, as applicable) rights therein. The Executive hereby appoints the Company as Executive’ s attorney-in-fact to execute on Executive’ s behalf any assignments or other documents deemed necessary by the Company to protect or perfect the Company’ s (and any of its Afﬁliates’, as applicable) rights to any Work Product. 6.2 Restriction on Competition . The Executive acknowledges that, in the course of Executive’ s employment with the Company and/or its Afﬁliates, he has become familiar , or will become familiar , with the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ and their predecessors’ trade secrets and with other Conﬁdential Information concerning the Company , its Afﬁliates and their respective predecessors and that Executive’ s services have been and will be of special, unique and extraordinary value to the Company and its Afﬁliates. The Executive agrees that if the Executive were to become employed by , or substantially involved in, the business of a competitor of the Company or any of its Afﬁliates following the Severance Date, it would be very difﬁcult for the Executive not to rely on or use the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information. Thus, to avoid the inevitable disclosure of the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information, and to protect such trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information and the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ relationships and goodwill with customers, during the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person engage in, enter the employ of, render any services to, have any ownership interest in, nor participate in the ﬁnancing, operation, 16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 33/541716/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 34/5418management or control of, any Competing Business. For purposes of this Agreement, the phrase “directly or indirectly through any other Person engage in” shall include, without limitation, any direct or indirect ownership or proﬁt participation interest in such enterprise, whether as an owner , stockholder , member , partner , joint venturer or otherwise, and shall include any direct or indirect participation in such enterprise as an employee, consultant, director , ofﬁcer , licensor of technology or otherwise. For purposes of this Agreement, “Competing Business ” means a Person anywhere in the continental United States and elsewhere in the world where the Company and its Afﬁliates engage in business, or reasonably anticipate engaging in business, on the Severance Date (the “ Restricted Area ”) that at any time during the Period of Employment has competed, or at any time during the twelve month period following the Severance Date competes, with the Company or any of its Afﬁliates in the passenger cruise ship industry (the “ Business ”). Nothing herein shall prohibit the Executive from being a passive owner of not more than 2% of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation which is publicly traded, so long as the Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive and the Company may agree that the Company shall waive all or a portion of the non-competition restrictions provided for in this Section 6.2 in exchange for the Executive’ s agreement to forfeit all or a portion of the Severance Beneﬁt payable under Section 5.3(b), the Change in Control Severance Beneﬁt payable under Section 5.3(c) or retirement beneﬁts in Section 5.3(d). Any such agreement between the Executive and the Company shall be documented in the general release agreement provided for in Section 5.4 or in such other written agreement between the Executive and the Company determined by the Company . 6.3 Non-Solicitation of Employees and Consultants . During the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person (i) induce or attempt to induce any employee or independent contractor of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company to leave the employ or service, as applicable, of the Company or such Afﬁliate, or in any way interfere with the relationship between the Company or any such Afﬁliate, on the one hand, and any employee or independent contractor thereof, on the other hand, or (ii) hire any person who was an employee of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company until twelve months after such individual’ s employment relationship with the Company or such Afﬁliate has been terminated. 6.4 Non-Solicitation of Customers . During the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person inﬂuence or attempt to inﬂuence customers, vendors, suppliers, licensors, lessors, joint venturers, associates, consultants, agents, or partners of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company to divert their business away from the Company or such Afﬁliate, and the Executive will not otherwise interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt the business relationships, contractual or otherwise, between the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company , on the one hand, and any of its or their customers, 16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 35/5416/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 36/5419suppliers, vendors, lessors, licensors, joint venturers, associates, ofﬁcers, employees, consultants, managers, partners, members or investors, on the other hand. 6.5 Understanding of Covenants . The Executive represents that he (i) is familiar with and has carefully considered the foregoing covenants set forth in this Section 6 (together , the “ Restrictive Covenants ”), (ii) is fully aware of Executive’ s obligations hereunder , (iii) agrees to the reasonableness of the length of time, scope and geographic coverage, as applicable, of the Restrictive Covenants, (iv) agrees that the Company and its Afﬁliates currently conduct business throughout the continental United States and the rest of the world, (v) agrees that the Restrictive Covenants are necessary to protect the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ conﬁdential and proprietary information, good will, stable workforce, and customer relations, and (vi) agrees that the Restrictive Covenants will continue in ef fect for the applicable periods set forth above in this Section 6 regardless of whether the Executive is then entitled to receive severance pay or beneﬁts from the Company . The Executive understands that the Restrictive Covenants may limit Executive’ s ability to earn a livelihood in a business similar to the Business of the Company and any of its Afﬁliates, but he nevertheless believes that he has received and will receive sufﬁcient consideration and other beneﬁts as an employee of the Company and as otherwise provided hereunder or as described in the recitals hereto to clearly justify such restrictions which, in any event (given Executive’ s education, skills and ability), the Executive does not believe would prevent Executive from otherwise earning a living. The Executive agrees that the Restrictive Covenants do not confer a beneﬁt upon the Company disproportionate to the detriment of the Executive. 6.6 Cooperation . Following the Executive’ s last day of employment by the Company , the Executive shall reasonably cooperate with the Company and its Afﬁliates in connection with: (a) any ongoing Company matter , internal or governmental investigation or administrative, regulatory , arbitral or judicial proceeding involving the Company and any Afﬁliates with respect to matters relating to the Executive’ s employment with, or service as a member of the board of directors of, the Company or any Afﬁliate (collectively , “Litigation”); or (b) any audit of the ﬁnancial statements of the Company or any Afﬁliate with respect to the period of time when the Executive was employed by the Company or any Afﬁliate (“ Audit ”). The Executive acknowledges that such cooperation may include, but shall not be limited to, the Executive making himself or herself available to the Company or any Afﬁliate (or their respective attorneys or auditors) upon reasonable notice for: (i) interviews, factual investigations, and providing declarations or afﬁdavits that provide truthful information in connection with any Litigation or Audit; (ii) appearing at the request of the Company or any Afﬁliate to give testimony without requiring service of a subpoena or other legal process; (iii) volunteering to the Company or any Afﬁliate pertinent information related to any Litigation or Audit; and (iv) turning over to the Company or any Afﬁliate any documents relevant to any Litigation or Audit that are or may come into the Executive’ s possession. The Company shall 16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 37/5416/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 38/5420reimburse the Executive for reasonable travel expenses incurred in connection with providing the services under this Section 6.6, including lodging and meals, upon the Executive’ s submission of receipts. If, due to an actual or potential conﬂict of interest, it is necessary for the Executive to retain separate counsel in connection with providing the services under this Section 6.6, and such counsel is not otherwise supplied by and at the expense of the Company (pursuant to indemniﬁcation rights of the Executive or otherwise), the Company shall further reimburse the Executive for the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel. 6.7 Enfor cement . The Executive agrees that the Executive’ s services are unique and that he has access to Conﬁdential Information and Work Product. Accordingly , without limiting the generality of Section 17, the Executive agrees that a breach by the Executive of any of the covenants in this Section 6 would cause immediate and irreparable harm to the Company that would be difﬁcult or impossible to measure, and that damages to the Company for any such injury would therefore be an inadequate remedy for any such breach. Therefore, the Executive agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Section 6, the Company shall be entitled, in addition to and without limitation upon all other remedies the Company may have under this Agreement, at law or otherwise, to obtain speciﬁc performance, injunctive relief and/or other appropriate relief (without posting any bond or deposit) in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions of this Section 6. The Executive further agrees that the applicable period of time any Restrictive Covenant is in ef fect following the Severance Date, as determined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, shall be extended by the same amount of time that Executive is in breach of any Restrictive Covenant. 7. Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary , the Company may withhold (or cause there to be withheld, as the case may be) from any amounts otherwise due or payable under or pursuant to this Agreement such federal, state and local income, employment, or other taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. 8. Successors and Assigns . (a) This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

Any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive upon or in the six (6) month period following the Executive’ s Separation from Service that are not so paid by reason of this Section 5.7(a) shall be paid (without interest) as soon as practicable (and in all events within thirty (30) days) after the date that is six (6) months after the Executive’ s Separation from Service (or, if earlier , as soon as practicable, and in all events within thirty (30) days, after the date of the Executive’ s death). (b) To the extent that any beneﬁts pursuant to Sections 5.3(b)(ii), (c)(ii) or (d)(v) or reimbursements pursuant to Section 4 are taxable to the Executive, any reimbursement payment due to the Executive pursuant to any such provision shall be paid to the Executive on or before the last day of the Executive’ s taxable year following the taxable year in which the related expense was incurred. The beneﬁts and reimbursements pursuant to Sections 5.3(b)(ii), (c)(ii) and (d)(v) and Section 4 are not subject to liquidation or exchange for another beneﬁt and the amount of such beneﬁts and reimbursements that the Executive receives in one taxable year shall not affect the amount of such beneﬁts or reimbursements that the Executive receives in any other taxable year . (c) Any installment payments provided for in this Agreement shall be treated as separate payments for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. To the extent required to avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, the deﬁnition of Change in Control will be interpreted to mean a change in the ownership, ef fective control or ownership of a substantial portion of assets of Parent within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. This Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A and 457A of the Code and shall be interpreted consistent with this intent so as to avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A and 457A of the Code. 5.8 Possible Limitation of Beneﬁts in Connection with a Change in Contr ol. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary , if following a change in ownership or effective control or in the ownership of a substantial portion of assets (in each case, within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code), the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any similar or successor tax (the “ Excise Tax”) applies to any payments, beneﬁts and/or amounts received by the Executive pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, including, without limitation, any acceleration of the vesting of outstanding stock options or other equity awards (collectively , the “ Total Payments ”), then the Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) so that the maximum amount of the Total Payments (after reduction) shall be one dollar ($1.00) less than the amount which would cause the Total Payments to be subject to the Excise Tax; provided that such reduction to the Total Payments shall be made only if the total after - tax beneﬁt to the Executive is greater after giving ef fect to such reduction16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 27/541416/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 28/54than if no such reduction had been made. If such a reduction is required, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Total Payments by ﬁrst reducing or eliminating any cash payments under this Agreement, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of stock options, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of other equity awards, then by reducing or eliminating any other remaining Total Payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with the payments which are to be paid the farthest in time from the date of the transaction triggering the Excise Tax. The provisions of this Section 5.8 shall take precedence over the provisions of any other plan, arrangement or agreement governing the Executive’ s rights and entitlements to any beneﬁts or compensation. 6. Protective Covenants. 6.1 Conﬁdential Information; Inventions . (a) The Executive shall not disclose or use at any time, either during the Period of Employment or thereafter , any Conﬁdential Information (as deﬁned below) of which the Executive is or becomes aware, whether or not such information is developed by Executive, except to the extent that such disclosure or use is directly related to and required by the Executive’ s performance in good faith of duties for the Company . The Executive will take all appropriate steps to safeguard Conﬁdential Information in Executive’ s possession and to protect it against disclosure, misuse, espionage, loss and theft. The Executive shall deliver to the Company at the termination of the Period of Employment, or at any time the Company may request, all memoranda, notes, plans, records, reports, computer tapes and software and other documents and data (and copies thereof) relating to the Conﬁdential Information or the Work Product (as hereinafter deﬁned) of the business of the Company or any of its Afﬁliates which the Executive may then possess or have under Executive’ s control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive may truthfully respond to a lawful and valid subpoena or other legal process, but shall give the Company the earliest possible notice thereof, shall, as much in advance of the return date as possible, make available to the Company and its counsel the documents and other information sought, and shall assist the Company and such counsel in resisting or otherwise responding to such process. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits Executive from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity , or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation. Executive does not need the prior authorization to make any such reports or disclosures and is not required to notify the Employer of such reports or disclosures. Pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, the Executive acknowledges that he may not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of conﬁdential information that: (a) is made in conﬁdence to a federal, state, or local16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 29/541516/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 30/54government ofﬁcial, either directly or indirectly , or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (b) is made in a complaint or other document that is ﬁled in a lawsuit or other proceeding, provided that such ﬁling is made under seal. Further , the Executive understands that the Company will not retaliate against him in any way for any such disclosure made in accordance with the law . In the event a disclosure is made, and the Executive ﬁles any type of proceeding against the Company alleging that the Company retaliated against the Executive because of his disclosure, the Executive may disclose the relevant conﬁdential information to his attorney and may use the conﬁdential information in the proceeding if (x) the Executive ﬁles any document containing the conﬁdential information under seal, and (y) the Executive does not otherwise disclose the conﬁdential information except pursuant to court order . (b) As used in this Agreement, the term “ Conﬁdential Information ” means information that is not generally known to the public and that is used, developed or obtained by the Company or its Afﬁliates in connection with their businesses, including, but not limited to, information, observations and data obtained by the Executive while employed by the Company or any predecessors thereof (including those obtained prior to the Ef fective Date) concerning (i) the business or af fairs of the Company (or such predecessors), (ii) products or services, (iii) fees, costs and pricing structures, (iv) designs, (v) analyses, (vi) drawings, photographs and reports, (vii) computer software, including operating systems, applications and program listings, (viii) ﬂow charts, manuals and documentation, (ix) data bases, (x) accounting and business methods, (xi) inventions, devices, new developments, methods and processes, whether patentable or unpatentable and whether or not reduced to practice, (xii) customers and clients and customer or client lists, (xiii) other copyrightable works, (xiv) all production methods, processes, technology and trade secrets, and (xv) all similar and related information in whatever form. Conﬁdential Information will not include any information that has been published (other than a disclosure by the Executive in breach of this Agreement) in a form generally available to the public prior to the date the Executive proposes to disclose or use such information. Conﬁdential Information will not be deemed to have been published merely because individual portions of the information have been separately published, but only if all material features comprising such information have been published in combination. (c) As used in this Agreement, the term “ Work Product ” means all inventions, innovations, improvements, technical information, systems, software developments, methods, designs, analyses, drawings, reports, service marks, trademarks, trade names, logos and all similar or related information (whether patentable or unpatentable, copyrightable, registerable as a trademark, reduced to writing, or otherwise) which relates16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 31/541616/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 32/54to the Company’ s or any of its Afﬁliates’ actual or anticipated business, research and development or existing or future products or services and which are conceived, developed or made by the Executive (whether or not during usual business hours, whether or not by the use of the facilities of the Company or any of its Afﬁliates, and whether or not alone or in conjunction with any other person) while employed by the Company (including those conceived, developed or made prior to the Ef fective Date) together with all patent applications, letters patent, trademark, trade name and service mark applications or registrations, copyrights and reissues thereof that may be granted for or upon any of the foregoing. All Work Product that the Executive may have discovered, invented or originated during Executive’ s employment by the Company or any of its Afﬁliates prior to the Ef fective Date or that he may discover , invent or originate during the Period of Employment or at any time prior to the Severance Date, shall be the exclusive property of the Company and its Afﬁliates, as applicable, and Executive hereby assigns all of Executive’ s right, title and interest in and to such Work Product to the Company or its applicable Afﬁliate, including all intellectual property rights therein. Executive shall promptly disclose all Work Product to the Company , shall execute at the request of the Company any assignments or other documents the Company may deem necessary to protect or perfect its (or any of its Afﬁliates’, as applicable) rights therein, and shall assist the Company , at the Company’ s expense, in obtaining, defending and enforcing the Company’ s (or any of its Afﬁliates’, as applicable) rights therein. The Executive hereby appoints the Company as Executive’ s attorney-in-fact to execute on Executive’ s behalf any assignments or other documents deemed necessary by the Company to protect or perfect the Company’ s (and any of its Afﬁliates’, as applicable) rights to any Work Product. 6.2 Restriction on Competition . The Executive acknowledges that, in the course of Executive’ s employment with the Company and/or its Afﬁliates, he has become familiar , or will become familiar , with the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ and their predecessors’ trade secrets and with other Conﬁdential Information concerning the Company , its Afﬁliates and their respective predecessors and that Executive’ s services have been and will be of special, unique and extraordinary value to the Company and its Afﬁliates. The Executive agrees that if the Executive were to become employed by , or substantially involved in, the business of a competitor of the Company or any of its Afﬁliates following the Severance Date, it would be very difﬁcult for the Executive not to rely on or use the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information. Thus, to avoid the inevitable disclosure of the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information, and to protect such trade secrets and Conﬁdential Information and the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ relationships and goodwill with customers, during the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person engage in, enter the employ of, render any services to, have any ownership interest in, nor participate in the ﬁnancing, operation, 16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 33/541716/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 34/5418management or control of, any Competing Business. For purposes of this Agreement, the phrase “directly or indirectly through any other Person engage in” shall include, without limitation, any direct or indirect ownership or proﬁt participation interest in such enterprise, whether as an owner , stockholder , member , partner , joint venturer or otherwise, and shall include any direct or indirect participation in such enterprise as an employee, consultant, director , ofﬁcer , licensor of technology or otherwise. For purposes of this Agreement, “Competing Business ” means a Person anywhere in the continental United States and elsewhere in the world where the Company and its Afﬁliates engage in business, or reasonably anticipate engaging in business, on the Severance Date (the “ Restricted Area ”) that at any time during the Period of Employment has competed, or at any time during the twelve month period following the Severance Date competes, with the Company or any of its Afﬁliates in the passenger cruise ship industry (the “ Business ”). Nothing herein shall prohibit the Executive from being a passive owner of not more than 2% of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation which is publicly traded, so long as the Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive and the Company may agree that the Company shall waive all or a portion of the non-competition restrictions provided for in this Section 6.2 in exchange for the Executive’ s agreement to forfeit all or a portion of the Severance Beneﬁt payable under Section 5.3(b), the Change in Control Severance Beneﬁt payable under Section 5.3(c) or retirement beneﬁts in Section 5.3(d). Any such agreement between the Executive and the Company shall be documented in the general release agreement provided for in Section 5.4 or in such other written agreement between the Executive and the Company determined by the Company . 6.3 Non-Solicitation of Employees and Consultants . During the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person (i) induce or attempt to induce any employee or independent contractor of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company to leave the employ or service, as applicable, of the Company or such Afﬁliate, or in any way interfere with the relationship between the Company or any such Afﬁliate, on the one hand, and any employee or independent contractor thereof, on the other hand, or (ii) hire any person who was an employee of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company until twelve months after such individual’ s employment relationship with the Company or such Afﬁliate has been terminated. 6.4 Non-Solicitation of Customers . During the Period of Employment and for a period of twenty-four months after the Severance Date, the Executive will not directly or indirectly through any other Person inﬂuence or attempt to inﬂuence customers, vendors, suppliers, licensors, lessors, joint venturers, associates, consultants, agents, or partners of the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company to divert their business away from the Company or such Afﬁliate, and the Executive will not otherwise interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt the business relationships, contractual or otherwise, between the Company or any Afﬁliate of the Company , on the one hand, and any of its or their customers, 16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 35/5416/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 36/5419suppliers, vendors, lessors, licensors, joint venturers, associates, ofﬁcers, employees, consultants, managers, partners, members or investors, on the other hand. 6.5 Understanding of Covenants . The Executive represents that he (i) is familiar with and has carefully considered the foregoing covenants set forth in this Section 6 (together , the “ Restrictive Covenants ”), (ii) is fully aware of Executive’ s obligations hereunder , (iii) agrees to the reasonableness of the length of time, scope and geographic coverage, as applicable, of the Restrictive Covenants, (iv) agrees that the Company and its Afﬁliates currently conduct business throughout the continental United States and the rest of the world, (v) agrees that the Restrictive Covenants are necessary to protect the Company’ s and its Afﬁliates’ conﬁdential and proprietary information, good will, stable workforce, and customer relations, and (vi) agrees that the Restrictive Covenants will continue in ef fect for the applicable periods set forth above in this Section 6 regardless of whether the Executive is then entitled to receive severance pay or beneﬁts from the Company . The Executive understands that the Restrictive Covenants may limit Executive’ s ability to earn a livelihood in a business similar to the Business of the Company and any of its Afﬁliates, but he nevertheless believes that he has received and will receive sufﬁcient consideration and other beneﬁts as an employee of the Company and as otherwise provided hereunder or as described in the recitals hereto to clearly justify such restrictions which, in any event (given Executive’ s education, skills and ability), the Executive does not believe would prevent Executive from otherwise earning a living. The Executive agrees that the Restrictive Covenants do not confer a beneﬁt upon the Company disproportionate to the detriment of the Executive. 6.6 Cooperation . Following the Executive’ s last day of employment by the Company , the Executive shall reasonably cooperate with the Company and its Afﬁliates in connection with: (a) any ongoing Company matter , internal or governmental investigation or administrative, regulatory , arbitral or judicial proceeding involving the Company and any Afﬁliates with respect to matters relating to the Executive’ s employment with, or service as a member of the board of directors of, the Company or any Afﬁliate (collectively , “Litigation”); or (b) any audit of the ﬁnancial statements of the Company or any Afﬁliate with respect to the period of time when the Executive was employed by the Company or any Afﬁliate (“ Audit ”). The Executive acknowledges that such cooperation may include, but shall not be limited to, the Executive making himself or herself available to the Company or any Afﬁliate (or their respective attorneys or auditors) upon reasonable notice for: (i) interviews, factual investigations, and providing declarations or afﬁdavits that provide truthful information in connection with any Litigation or Audit; (ii) appearing at the request of the Company or any Afﬁliate to give testimony without requiring service of a subpoena or other legal process; (iii) volunteering to the Company or any Afﬁliate pertinent information related to any Litigation or Audit; and (iv) turning over to the Company or any Afﬁliate any documents relevant to any Litigation or Audit that are or may come into the Executive’ s possession. The Company shall 16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 37/5416/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 38/5420reimburse the Executive for reasonable travel expenses incurred in connection with providing the services under this Section 6.6, including lodging and meals, upon the Executive’ s submission of receipts. If, due to an actual or potential conﬂict of interest, it is necessary for the Executive to retain separate counsel in connection with providing the services under this Section 6.6, and such counsel is not otherwise supplied by and at the expense of the Company (pursuant to indemniﬁcation rights of the Executive or otherwise), the Company shall further reimburse the Executive for the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel. 6.7 Enfor cement . The Executive agrees that the Executive’ s services are unique and that he has access to Conﬁdential Information and Work Product. Accordingly , without limiting the generality of Section 17, the Executive agrees that a breach by the Executive of any of the covenants in this Section 6 would cause immediate and irreparable harm to the Company that would be difﬁcult or impossible to measure, and that damages to the Company for any such injury would therefore be an inadequate remedy for any such breach. Therefore, the Executive agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Section 6, the Company shall be entitled, in addition to and without limitation upon all other remedies the Company may have under this Agreement, at law or otherwise, to obtain speciﬁc performance, injunctive relief and/or other appropriate relief (without posting any bond or deposit) in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions of this Section 6. The Executive further agrees that the applicable period of time any Restrictive Covenant is in ef fect following the Severance Date, as determined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, shall be extended by the same amount of time that Executive is in breach of any Restrictive Covenant. 7. Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary , the Company may withhold (or cause there to be withheld, as the case may be) from any amounts otherwise due or payable under or pursuant to this Agreement such federal, state and local income, employment, or other taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. 8. Successors and Assigns . (a) This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the beneﬁt of and be enforceable by the Executive’ s legal representatives. (b) This Agreement shall inure to the beneﬁt of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, mer ger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 39/5416/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 40/5421Company to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.

Number and Gender; Examples . Where the context requires, the singular shall include the plural, the plural shall include the singular , and any gender shall include all other genders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn (as to geographic scope, period of duration or otherwise) so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or af fecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.16/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 41/5416/04/2025, 06:33 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1031608 42/542213.

All payments and beneﬁts that are payable upon a termination of employment hereunder shall be paid or provided only upon Executive’ s “separation from service” from the Company (within the meaning of Section 409A). For purposes of Section 409A (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), Executive’ s right to receive any installment payments under this Agreement (whether severance payments, reimbursements or otherwise) shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly , each installment payment hereunder shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if Executive is deemed by the Company at the time of Executive’ s termination to be a “speciﬁed employee” for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), and if any of the payments upon termination set forth herein and/or under any other agreement with the Company are deemed to be “deferred compensation”, then to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of such payments is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) and the related adverse taxation under Section 409A, such payments shall not be provided to Executive prior to the earliest of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of Executive’ s termination with the Company , (ii) the date of Executive’ s death or (iii) such earlier date as permitted under Section 409A without the imposition of adverse taxation.

No interest shall be due on any amounts so deferred. 9. Section 280G . In the event that the severance and other beneﬁts provided for in this Agreement or otherwise payable to Executive (i) constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this Section 9, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then, Executive’ s severance and other beneﬁts under this Agreement shall be payable either (i) in full, or (ii) as to such lesser amount which would result in no portion of such severance and other beneﬁts being subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, results in the receipt by Employee on an after-tax basis of the greatest amount of severance beneﬁts under this Agreement, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such severance beneﬁts may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. Any reduction shall be made in the following manner: ﬁrst a pro rata reduction of (i) cash payments subject to Section 409A as deferred compensation and (ii) cash payments not subject to Section 409A, and second a pro rata cancellation of (i) equity-based compensation subject to Section 409A as deferred compensation and (ii) equity-based compensation not subject to Section 409A. Reduction in either cash payments or equity compensation beneﬁts shall be made prorata between and among beneﬁts which are subject to Section 409A and beneﬁts which are exempt from Section 409A. Unless the Company and Employee otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section 9 shall be made in writing by the Company’ s independent public accountants (the “ Accountants ”), whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Employee and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 9, the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and Employee shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 9. The Company shall bear all costs the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 9. 10. Deﬁnitions. 10.1 Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” for termination will mean: (a) a material breach of any of Executive’ s obligations or duties pursuant to this Agreement or the Conﬁdentiality Agreement, which remains uncured seven days after Executive becomes aware of the breach by formal written notiﬁcation by the Company; (b) gross negligence or willful misconduct in the course of employment; (c) any action or activity that is contrary to applicable insider trading rules or any other applicable securities rules or legislation; or (d) a material act or omission involving substantial dishonesty or fraud that harms or would reasonably be expected to harm the Company . 10.2 Good Reason.

Upon termination of the Executive’s employment by the Company for Cause, all compensation and benefits to the Executive hereunder shall cease and the Executive shall be entitled only to payment upon the effective date of termination of any accrued but unpaid Base Salary and unused vacation as provided in Sections 5.1 and 5.4 as of the date of such termination and any unpaid Target Bonus that may have been awarded the Executive as provided in Section 5.2 prior to such date. Snowdy, S Employment Agreement – 2023 316/04/2025, 06:37 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037495 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037495 3/12 6.2. Termination by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason. The Company may also terminate the Executive’s employment without Cause upon ten days’ notice to the Executive and the Executive may also terminate the Executive’s employment for Good Reason (as defined below) upon ten days’ written notice to the Company. Upon termination of the Executive’s employment by the Company without Cause or the Executive’s termination of the Executive’s employment for Good Reason, all compensation and benefits to the Executive hereunder shall cease and the Executive shall be entitled to, subject to Section 20, (1) any accrued but unpaid Base Salary and unused vacation as of the date of such termination as required by California law, which shall be due and payable upon the effective date of such termination, (2) any unpaid Target Bonus that may have been awarded to the Executive under Section 5.2 prior to such date, which shall be due and payable in accordance with the Company’s normal payroll policies and procedures or as otherwise required by California law, (3) all of the Executive’s vested stock options and other equity awards as of the date of termination of the Executive’s employment shall remain exercisable for their full term, subject to the terms of the applicable award agreements, (4) retain and have full ownership of all electronic devices provided to the Executive (including, without limitation, a computer, telephone, tablet and printer), provided that all the Company confidential information shall be deleted by the Company from such devices before releasing them to the Executive, (5) a lump sum amount, which shall be due and payable within ten days following the effective date of the Release (as defined above), equal to twelve months of the Executive’s Base Salary as provided in Section 5.1 and an amount equal to the prorated portion of the Target Bonus provided in Section 5.2 for the year in which the termination occurred based on the number of days the Executive was employed, provided, that if such termination occurs within six months prior to or within twelve months following a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined), then the amount described in this clause (5) shall be equal to eighteen months of the Executive’s Base Salary as provided in Section 5.1, and the full Target Bonus amount as provided in Section 5.2, and (6) reimbursement of the Executive and his dependents for a period of twelve months following such termination (eighteen months if such termination occurs within six months prior to or within twelve months following a Change of Control) of all the premiums associated with Executive’s continuation of health insurance pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (“COBRA”), as applicable, provided, that the Executive timely elects and is eligible to continue to receive COBRA benefits (less all applicable tax withholdings), payable in accordance with the Company’s usual reimbursement practices and policies in effect from time to time. The Executive’s right to the compensation and benefits provided for in clauses (5) and (6) of this Section shall be conditioned upon the Executive having executed and delivered to the Company the Release, provided that the compensation and benefits shall be paid or commence, as applicable, after the time period for the Executive to execute, return and revoke the Release has expired (and if such time period begins in one taxable year and ends in a second taxable year, no payment shall be made until the first payroll period in the second taxable year). For purposes of this Section 6.2: (a) “Change of Control” shall mean a “change in ownership or effective control of a corporation, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of a corporation,” as applied to the Company, within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and Treas. Reg. §1.409A-3(i)(5). (b) “Good Reason” shall mean any material breach by the Company of the terms hereof that is not corrected by the Company within five days after written notice by the Executive to the Company, including, without limitation, (i) the assignment to the Executive of any duties inconsistent in any respect with his position as the Chief Executive Officer (including status, offices, titles, reporting requirements, authority, duties or responsibilities); or (ii) any failure by the Company to comply with its compensation obligations under this Agreement. If the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason, subject to the Company’s right to cure as set forth above, the termination shall take effect on the effective date of the written notice to the Company (determined under Section 15). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Executive does not terminate his employment for Good Reason within thirty days after the Company’s failure to cure as provided herein, such condition giving rise to a “Good Reason” shall no longer constitute Good Reason for the Executive to terminate his employment.

In the event of the Executive’s death or “Disability” (as defined below) during the Term, the Executive’s employment shall automatically cease and terminate as of the date of the Executive’s death or the effective date of the Company’s written notice to the Executive of its decision to terminate his employment by reason of his Disability, as the case may be, and the Executive or his heirs or personal representative shall be entitled to the same payments and benefits, at the same times, as described in Section 6.2 for a termination of employment by the Company without Cause and all of the Executive’s stock options and any other equity awards based on the Company securities held by the Executive at the time of his death or Disability shall immediately vest in full and shall remain exercisable thereafter for their full term. In addition, the Executive or his heirs or personal representative shall be entitled to retain and have full ownership of all electronic devices provided to the Executive (including, without limitation, a computer, telephone and tablet); provided that all the Company confidential information shall be deleted by the Company from such devices before releasing them to the Executive or such heirs or personal representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision of Section 6.2, the Company’s obligation to pay the Executive the Base Salary provided in Section 6.2 for the severance period following termination of his employment by reason of his Disability shall be subject to offset and shall be reduced by any and all amounts paid to the Executive under any disability insurance policy paid or provided for by the Company as provided in Section 5.5 or otherwise. The Executive’s “Disability” shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in any policy of disability insurance maintained by the Company (or by the Executive, as the case may be) with respect to the Executive or, if no such policy is then in effect, shall mean the Executive’s inability to fully perform his duties hereunder for any period of at least 75 consecutive days or for a total of 90 days, whether or not consecutive. 7. Confidentiality. While this Agreement is in effect and for a period of five years thereafter, the Executive shall hold and keep secret and confidential all “trade secrets” (within the meaning of applicable law) and other confidential or proprietary information of the Company and shall use such information only in the course of performing the Executive’s duties hereunder; provided, however, that with respect to trade secrets, the Executive shall hold and keep secret and confidential such trade secrets for so long as they remain trade secrets under applicable law. The Executive shall maintain in trust all such trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary information, as the Company’s property, including, but not limited to, all documents concerning the Company’s business, including the Executive’s work papers, telephone directories, customer information and notes, and any and all copies thereof in the Executive’s possession or under the Executive’s control. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Executive’s employment with the Company, or upon request by the Company, the Executive shall deliver to the Company all such documents belonging to the Company, including any and all copies in the Executive’s possession or under the Executive’s control. 8. Equitable Remedies; Injunctive Relief. The Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees that monetary damages are inadequate to fully compensate the Company for the damages that would result from a breach or threatened breach of Section 7 of this Agreement and, accordingly, that the Company shall be entitled to equitable remedies, including, without limitation, specific performance, temporary restraining orders, and preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions, to enforce such Section without the necessity of proving actual damages in connection therewith. This provision shall not, however, diminish the Company’s right to claim and recover damages or enforce any other of its legal or equitable rights or defenses.

The Company and the Executive acknowledge that, as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the Executive shall be a corporate officer of the Company and, as such, the Executive shall be entitled to indemnification to the full extent provided by the Company to its officers, directors and agents under the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. the Company shall maintain the Executive as an additional insured under its current policy of directors and officers liability insurance and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to insure the Executive thereunder, or under any replacement policies in effect from time to time, during the Term. 10. Severable Provisions. The provisions of this Agreement are severable and if any one or more provisions is determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions, and any partially unenforceable provisions to the extent enforceable, shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable. 11. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the Company, its successors and assigns and the Executive and his heirs and representatives; provided, that this Agreement may be assigned by the Company to a successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company. 12. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and the parties hereto have made no agreements, representations or warranties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement that are not set forth otherwise herein. This Agreement supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements, written or oral, between the Executive and the Company relating to the subject matter hereof. Any such prior or contemporaneous agreements are hereby terminated and of no further effect, and the Executive, by the execution hereof, agrees that any compensation provided for under any such agreements is specifically superseded and replaced by the provisions of this Agreement. 13. Amendment. No modification of this Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by the parties hereto and unless such writing is made by an executive officer of the Company (other than the Executive). The parties hereto agree that in no event shall an oral modification of this Agreement be enforceable or valid. 14. Governing Law. This Agreement is and shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to California’s choice-of-law rules.

A counterpart executed and transmitted by facsimile shall have the same force and effect as an originally executed counterpart. 18. Attorney’s Fees.

Upon the expiration of the applicable deferral period described in the immediately preceding sentence, any payments which would have otherwise been made during that period (whether in a single sum or in installments) in the absence of this Section 20 shall be paid to the Executive or the Executive’s beneficiary in one lump sum, plus interest thereon at the Delayed Payment Interest Rate computed from the date on which each such delayed payment otherwise would have been made to the Executive until the date of payment. For purposes of the foregoing, the “Delayed Payment Interest Rate” shall mean the national average annual rate of interest payable on jumbo six-month bank certificates of deposit, as quoted in the business section of the most recently published Sunday edition of The New York Times preceding the Executive’s separation from service. 20.2. To the extent any benefits provided under Section 6.2 above are otherwise taxable to the Executive, such benefits shall, for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, be provided as separate in-kind payments of those benefits, and the provision of in-kind benefits during one calendar year shall not affect the in-kind benefits to be provided in any other calendar year. 20.3. In the case of any amounts payable to the Executive under this Agreement, or under any plan of the Company, that may be treated as payable in the form of “a series of installment payments,” as defined in Treas. Reg. §1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii), the Executive’s right to receive such payments shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments for purposes of Treas. Reg. §1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii). 20.4. It is intended that this Agreement comply with or be exempt from the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and guidance of general applicability issued thereunder, and in furtherance of this intent, this Agreement shall be interpreted, operated, and administered in a manner consistent with such intent.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the Executive and the Company agree as follows: 1. The Executive, for himself, his spouse, heirs, administrators, children, representatives, executors, successors, assigns, and all other persons claiming through the Executive, if any (collectively, “Releasers”), does hereby release, waive, and forever discharge the Company and each of its agents, subsidiaries, parents, affiliates, related organizations, executives, officers, directors, attorneys, successors, and assigns (collectively, the “Releasees”) from, and does fully waive any obligations of Releasees to Releasers for, any and all liability, actions, charges, causes of action, obligations, demands, damages, or claims for relief, remuneration, sums of money, accounts or expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs) of any kind whatsoever, whether known or unknown or contingent or absolute, which heretofore has been or which hereafter may be suffered or sustained, directly or indirectly, by Releasers in consequence of, arising out of, or in any way relating to: (a) the Executive’s employment with and services to the Company or any of its affiliates; (b) the termination of the Executive’s employment with and services to the Company and any of its affiliates; or (c) any event whatsoever occurring on or prior to the date of this General Release. The foregoing release and discharge, waiver and covenant not to sue includes, but is not limited to, all claims and any obligations or causes of action arising from such claims, under common law including, but not limited to, wrongful or retaliatory discharge, breach of contract (including but not limited to any claims under any employment agreement between the Executive, on the one hand, and the Company or its affiliates, on the other hand) and any action arising in tort including, but not limited to, libel, slander, defamation or intentional infliction of emotional distress, and claims under any federal, state or local statute including the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and 1871 (42 U.S.C. § 1981), the National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the California Family Rights Act or the discrimination or employment laws of any state or municipality, and any claims under any express or implied contract which Releasers may claim existed with Releasees. This also includes, but is not limited to, a release of any claims for wrongful discharge and all claims for alleged physical or personal injury, emotional distress relating to or arising out of the Executive’s employment with or services to the Company or any of its affiliates or the termination of that employment or those services; and any claims under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, California Labor Code Section 1400 et seq. or any similar law, which requires, among other things, that advance notice be given of certain work force reductions. This release and waiver does not apply to: (i) the Executive’s rights to receive the compensation and benefits provided for in clauses (1) through (2) of Section 6.2, as applicable, of the Employment Agreement; or (ii) the Executive’s rights under any stock option agreement between the Executive and the Company. Snowdy, S Employment Agreement – 2023 1016/04/2025, 06:37 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037495 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037495 10/12 2. The Executive understands and agrees that he is expressly waiving all rights afforded by Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California (“Section 1542”) with respect to the Releasees. Section 1542 states as follows: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1542, and for the purpose of implementing a full and complete release, the Executive understands and agrees that this General Release is intended to include all claims, if any, which the Executive may have and which he does not now know or suspect to exist in his favor against the Releasees and the Executive understands and agrees that this Agreement extinguishes those claims. 3. Excluded from this General Release and waiver are any claims which cannot be waived by law, including but not limited to the right to participate in an investigation conducted by certain government agencies. The Executive, however, waives the Executive’s right to any monetary recovery should any agency (such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing) pursue any claims on the Executive’s behalf. The Executive represents and warrants that the Executive has not filed any complaint, charge or lawsuit against the Releasees with any government agency or any court. 4. The Executive agrees never to seek personal recovery from Releasees in any forum for any claim covered by the above waiver and release language, except that the Executive may bring a claim under the ADEA to challenge this General Release. Nothing in this General Release is intended to reflect any party’s belief that the Executive’s waiver of claims under ADEA is invalid or unenforceable, it being the intent of the parties that such claims are waived. 5. The Executive acknowledges and recites that: (a) The Executive has executed this General Release knowingly and voluntarily; (b) The Executive has read and understands this General Release in its entirety; Snowdy, S Employment Agreement – 2023 1116/04/2025, 06:37 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037495 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037495 11/12 (c) The Executive acknowledges that he has been advised by his own legal counsel and has sought such other advice as he wishes with respect to the terms of this General Release before executing it; (d) The Executive’s execution of this General Release has not been forced by any the Executive or agent of the Company, and the Executive has had an opportunity to negotiate about the terms of this General Release; and (e) The Executive has not sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed any claim, demand, right, action, suit, cause of action or other interest that is the subject matter of this General Release. 6. This General Release shall be governed by the internal laws (and not the choice of laws) of the State of California, except for the application of preemptive Federal law. 7. The Executive acknowledges that he is waiving his rights under the ADEA and the Older Worker’s Benefit Protection Act and therefore, in compliance with those statutes, acknowledges the following: The Executive acknowledges that he has been provided a minimum of twenty-one calendar days after receipt of this Agreement to consider whether to sign it; The Executive acknowledges that he shall have seven days from the date he executes this General Release to revoke his waiver and release of any ADEA claims only (but not his waiver or release hereunder of other claims) by providing written notice of the revocation to the Company, and that, in the event of such revocation, the provisions of Section 4 or clauses (4) through (6) of Section 6.2, as applicable, of the Employment Agreement shall thereupon become null and void and the Company shall be entitled to a return from the Executive of all payments to the Executive pursuant to such clauses; The Executive acknowledges that this waiver and release does not apply to any rights or claims that may arise under ADEA after the effective date of this Agreement; and The Executive acknowledges that the consideration given in exchange for this waiver and release Agreement is in addition to anything of value to which he was already entitled. PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IT CONTAINS A RELEASE OF ALL KNOWN AND UNKNOWN CLAIMS.

The Executive understands and agrees that his duties, title and authority may be changed from time to time in the discretion of the Company’s Chair of the Board.

The Executive also shall be eligible for an annual target performance-based bonus for the Executive’s services equal to 40% of the Base Salary during the Term, less applicable payroll deductions and tax withholdings (the “Target Bonus”). Target Bonuses do not constitute a promise of payment and the Executive’s actual bonus, if any, will depend in part on the Company’s performance and the Compensation Committee’s discretion in assessing the Executive’s individual performance in relation to his objectives as determined by the Board and the overall performance and status of the Company. Any Target Bonus payable to the Executive shall be paid with respect to a performance period consistent with the Company’s standard timing for paying such bonuses and in any event no later than February 28th of the calendar year following the calendar year to which the Target Bonus relates. 5.3.

Termination. This Agreement may be terminated as set forth in this Section 6. 6.1. Termination by the Company for Cause. The Company may terminate the Executive’s employment hereunder for “Cause” upon notice to the Executive. “Cause” for this purpose shall mean any of the following: Caloz, J. Employment Agreement – 2023 216/04/2025, 06:37 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 2/12 (a) The Executive’s breach of any material term of this Agreement; provided that the first occasion of any particular breach shall not constitute such Cause unless the Executive shall have previously received written notice from the Company stating the nature of such breach and affording the Executive at least ten days to correct such breach; (b) The Executive’s conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, any misdemeanor, felony or other crime of moral turpitude; (c) The Executive’s act of fraud or dishonesty injurious to the Company or its reputation; (d) The Executive’s continual failure or refusal to perform his material duties as required under this Agreement after written notice from the Company stating the nature of such failure or refusal and affording the Executive at least ten days to correct the same; (e) The Executive’s act or omission that, in the reasonable determination of the Company’s Board of Directors (or a Committee of the Board), indicates alcohol or drug abuse by the Executive; or (f) The Executive’s act or personal conduct that, in the judgment of the Company’s Board of Directors (or a Committee of the Board), gives rise to a material risk of liability of the Executive or the Company under federal or applicable state law for discrimination, or sexual or other forms of harassment, or other similar liabilities to subordinate employees. Upon termination of the Executive’s employment by the Company for Cause, all compensation and benefits to the Executive hereunder shall cease and the Executive shall be entitled only to payment upon the effective date of termination of any accrued but unpaid Base Salary and unused vacation as provided in Sections 5.1 and 5.4 as of the date of such termination and any unpaid Target Bonus that may have been awarded the Executive as provided in Section 5.2 prior to such date. Caloz, J. Employment Agreement – 2023 316/04/2025, 06:37 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 3/12 6.2. Termination by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason. The Company may also terminate the Executive’s employment without Cause upon ten days’ notice to the Executive and the Executive may also terminate the Executive’s employment for Good Reason (as defined below) upon ten days’ written notice to the Company. Upon termination of the Executive’s employment by the Company without Cause or the Executive’s termination of the Executive’s employment for Good Reason, all compensation and benefits to the Executive hereunder shall cease and the Executive shall be entitled to, subject to Section 20, (1) any accrued but unpaid Base Salary and unused vacation as of the date of such termination as required by California law, which shall be due and payable upon the effective date of such termination, (2) any unpaid Target Bonus that may have been awarded to the Executive under Section 5.2 prior to such date, which shall be due and payable in accordance with the Company’s normal payroll policies and procedures or as otherwise required by California law, (3) all of the Executive’s vested stock options and other equity awards as of the date of termination of the Executive’s employment shall remain exercisable for their full term, subject to the terms of the applicable award agreements, (4) retain and have full ownership of all electronic devices provided to the Executive (including, without limitation, a computer, telephone, tablet and printer), provided that all the Company confidential information shall be deleted by the Company from such devices before releasing them to the Executive, (5) a lump sum amount, which shall be due and payable within ten days following the effective date of the Release (as defined above), equal to twelve months of the Executive’s Base Salary as provided in Section 5.1 and an amount equal to the prorated portion of the Target Bonus provided in Section 5.2 for the year in which the termination occurred based on the number of days the Executive was employed, provided, that if such termination occurs within six months prior to or within twelve months following a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined), then the amount described in this clause (5) shall be equal to eighteen months of the Executive’s Base Salary as provided in Section 5.1, and the full Target Bonus amount as provided in Section 5.2, and (6) reimbursement of the Executive and his dependents for a period of twelve months following such termination (eighteen months if such termination occurs within six months prior to or within twelve months following a Change of Control) of all Medicare premiums and the premiums associated with Executive’s continuation of health insurance pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (“COBRA”), as applicable, provided, that the Executive timely elects and is eligible to continue to receive COBRA benefits (less all applicable tax withholdings), payable in accordance with the Company’s usual reimbursement practices and policies in effect from time to time. The Executive’s right to the compensation and benefits provided for in clauses (5) and (6) of this Section shall be conditioned upon the Executive having executed and delivered to the Company the Release, provided that the compensation and benefits shall be paid or commence, as applicable, after the time period for the Executive to execute, return and revoke the Release has expired (and if such time period begins in one taxable year and ends in a second taxable year, no payment shall be made until the first payroll period in the second taxable year). For purposes of this Section 6.2: (a) “Change of Control” shall mean a “change in ownership or effective control of a corporation, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of a corporation,” as applied to the Company, within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and Treas. Reg. §1.409A-3(i)(5). (b) “Good Reason” shall mean any material breach by the Company of the terms hereof that is not corrected by the Company within five days after written notice by the Executive to the Company, including, without limitation, (i) the assignment to the Executive of any duties inconsistent in any respect with his position as the Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President (including status, offices, titles, reporting requirements, authority, duties or responsibilities); or (ii) any failure by the Company to comply with its compensation obligations under this Agreement. If the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason, subject to the Company’s right to cure as set forth above, the termination shall take effect on the effective date of the written notice to the Company (determined under Section 15). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Executive does not terminate his employment for Good Reason within thirty days after the Company’s failure to cure as provided herein, such condition giving rise to a “Good Reason” shall no longer constitute Good Reason for the Executive to terminate his employment. Caloz, J. Employment Agreement – 2023 416/04/2025, 06:37 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 4/12 6.3. Death or Disability. In the event of the Executive’s death or “Disability” (as defined below) during the Term, the Executive’s employment shall automatically cease and terminate as of the date of the Executive’s death or the effective date of the Company’s written notice to the Executive of its decision to terminate his employment by reason of his Disability, as the case may be, and the Executive or his heirs or personal representative shall be entitled to the same payments and benefits, at the same times, as described in Section 6.2 for a termination of employment by the Company without Cause and all of the Executive’s stock options and any other equity awards based on the Company securities held by the Executive at the time of his death or Disability shall immediately vest in full and shall remain exercisable thereafter for their full term. In addition, the Executive or his heirs or personal representative shall be entitled to retain and have full ownership of all electronic devices provided to the Executive (including, without limitation, a computer, telephone and tablet); provided that all the Company confidential information shall be deleted by the Company from such devices before releasing them to the Executive or such heirs or personal representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision of Section 6.2, the Company’s obligation to pay the Executive the Base Salary provided in Section 6.2 for the severance period following termination of his employment by reason of his Disability shall be subject to offset and shall be reduced by any and all amounts paid to the Executive under any disability insurance policy paid or provided for by the Company as provided in Section 5.5 or otherwise. The Executive’s “Disability” shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in any policy of disability insurance maintained by the Company (or by the Executive, as the case may be) with respect to the Executive or, if no such policy is then in effect, shall mean the Executive’s inability to fully perform his duties hereunder for any period of at least 75 consecutive days or for a total of 90 days, whether or not consecutive. 7. Confidentiality. While this Agreement is in effect and for a period of five years thereafter, the Executive shall hold and keep secret and confidential all “trade secrets” (within the meaning of applicable law) and other confidential or proprietary information of the Company and shall use such information only in the course of performing the Executive’s duties hereunder; provided, however, that with respect to trade secrets, the Executive shall hold and keep secret and confidential such trade secrets for so long as they remain trade secrets under applicable law. The Executive shall maintain in trust all such trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary information, as the Company’s property, including, but not limited to, all documents concerning the Company’s business, including the Executive’s work papers, telephone directories, customer information and notes, and any and all copies thereof in the Executive’s possession or under the Executive’s control. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Executive’s employment with the Company, or upon request by the Company, the Executive shall deliver to the Company all such documents belonging to the Company, including any and all copies in the Executive’s possession or under the Executive’s control. 8. Equitable Remedies; Injunctive Relief. The Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees that monetary damages are inadequate to fully compensate the Company for the damages that would result from a breach or threatened breach of Section 7 of this Agreement and, accordingly, that the Company shall be entitled to equitable remedies, including, without limitation, specific performance, temporary restraining orders, and preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions, to enforce such Section without the necessity of proving actual damages in connection therewith. This provision shall not, however, diminish the Company’s right to claim and recover damages or enforce any other of its legal or equitable rights or defenses. Caloz, J.

The Company and the Executive acknowledge that, as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, the Executive shall be a corporate officer of the Company and, as such, the Executive shall be entitled to indemnification to the full extent provided by the Company to its officers, directors and agents under the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. the Company shall maintain the Executive as an additional insured under its current policy of directors and officers liability insurance and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to insure the Executive thereunder, or under any replacement policies in effect from time to time, during the Term. 10. Severable Provisions. The provisions of this Agreement are severable and if any one or more provisions is determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions, and any partially unenforceable provisions to the extent enforceable, shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable. 11. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the Company, its successors and assigns and the Executive and his heirs and representatives; provided, that this Agreement may be assigned by the Company to a successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company. 12. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and the parties hereto have made no agreements, representations or warranties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement that are not set forth otherwise herein. This Agreement supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements, written or oral, between the Executive and the Company relating to the subject matter hereof. Any such prior or contemporaneous agreements are hereby terminated and of no further effect, and the Executive, by the execution hereof, agrees that any compensation provided for under any such agreements is specifically superseded and replaced by the provisions of this Agreement. 13. Amendment. No modification of this Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by the parties hereto and unless such writing is made by an executive officer of the Company (other than the Executive). The parties hereto agree that in no event shall an oral modification of this Agreement be enforceable or valid. 14. Governing Law. This Agreement is and shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to California’s choice-of-law rules. Caloz, J.

The provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a reasonable manner to effect the intentions of the parties hereto. Caloz, J. Employment Agreement – 2023 716/04/2025, 06:37 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 7/12 20. Code Section 409A. 20.1. To the extent (a) any payments to which the Executive becomes entitled under this Agreement, or any agreement or plan referenced herein, in connection with the Executive’s termination of employment with the Company constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code; (b) the Executive is deemed at the time of his separation from service to be a “specified employee” under Section 409A of the Code; and (c) at the time of the Executive’s separation from service the Company is publicly traded (as defined in Section 409A of Code), then such payments (other than any payments permitted by Section 409A of the Code to be paid within six months of the Executive’s separation from service) shall not be made until the earlier of (x) the first day of the seventh month following the Executive’s separation from service or (y) the date of the Executive’s death following such separation from service. Upon the expiration of the applicable deferral period described in the immediately preceding sentence, any payments which would have otherwise been made during that period (whether in a single sum or in installments) in the absence of this Section 20 shall be paid to the Executive or the Executive’s beneficiary in one lump sum, plus interest thereon at the Delayed Payment Interest Rate computed from the date on which each such delayed payment otherwise would have been made to the Executive until the date of payment. For purposes of the foregoing, the “Delayed Payment Interest Rate” shall mean the national average annual rate of interest payable on jumbo six-month bank certificates of deposit, as quoted in the business section of the most recently published Sunday edition of The New York Times preceding the Executive’s separation from service. 20.2. To the extent any benefits provided under Section 6.2 above are otherwise taxable to the Executive, such benefits shall, for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, be provided as separate in-kind payments of those benefits, and the provision of in-kind benefits during one calendar year shall not affect the in-kind benefits to be provided in any other calendar year. 20.3. In the case of any amounts payable to the Executive under this Agreement, or under any plan of the Company, that may be treated as payable in the form of “a series of installment payments,” as defined in Treas. Reg. §1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii), the Executive’s right to receive such payments shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments for purposes of Treas. Reg. §1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii). 20.4. It is intended that this Agreement comply with or be exempt from the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and guidance of general applicability issued thereunder, and in furtherance of this intent, this Agreement shall be interpreted, operated, and administered in a manner consistent with such intent.

Employment Agreement – 2023 916/04/2025, 06:37 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 9/12 EXHIBIT A GENERAL RELEASE OF ALL CLAIMS This General Release of All Claims is made as of December __, 2022 (this “General Release”), by and between John Caloz (the “Executive”) and LadRx Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), with reference to the following facts: WHEREAS, this General Release is provided for in, and is in furtherance of, the Employment Agreement, dated as of December __, 2022, between the Company and the Executive (the “Employment Agreement”); WHEREAS, the Executive desires to execute and deliver to the Company this General Release in consideration of the Company’s providing the Executive with certain severance benefits pursuant to Section 4 or Section 6.2, as applicable, of the Employment Agreement; and WHEREAS, the Executive and the Company intend that this General Release shall be in full satisfaction of any and all obligations described in this General Release owed to the Executive by the Company, except as expressly provided in this General Release. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the Executive and the Company agree as follows: 1. The Executive, for himself, his spouse, heirs, administrators, children, representatives, executors, successors, assigns, and all other persons claiming through the Executive, if any (collectively, “Releasers”), does hereby release, waive, and forever discharge the Company and each of its agents, subsidiaries, parents, affiliates, related organizations, executives, officers, directors, attorneys, successors, and assigns (collectively, the “Releasees”) from, and does fully waive any obligations of Releasees to Releasers for, any and all liability, actions, charges, causes of action, obligations, demands, damages, or claims for relief, remuneration, sums of money, accounts or expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs) of any kind whatsoever, whether known or unknown or contingent or absolute, which heretofore has been or which hereafter may be suffered or sustained, directly or indirectly, by Releasers in consequence of, arising out of, or in any way relating to: (a) the Executive’s employment with and services to the Company or any of its affiliates; (b) the termination of the Executive’s employment with and services to the Company and any of its affiliates; or (c) any event whatsoever occurring on or prior to the date of this General Release. The foregoing release and discharge, waiver and covenant not to sue includes, but is not limited to, all claims and any obligations or causes of action arising from such claims, under common law including, but not limited to, wrongful or retaliatory discharge, breach of contract (including but not limited to any claims under any employment agreement between the Executive, on the one hand, and the Company or its affiliates, on the other hand) and any action arising in tort including, but not limited to, libel, slander, defamation or intentional infliction of emotional distress, and claims under any federal, state or local statute including the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and 1871 (42 U.S.C. § 1981), the National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the California Family Rights Act or the discrimination or employment laws of any state or municipality, and any claims under any express or implied contract which Releasers may claim existed with Releasees. This also includes, but is not limited to, a release of any claims for wrongful discharge and all claims for alleged physical or personal injury, emotional distress relating to or arising out of the Executive’s employment with or services to the Company or any of its affiliates or the termination of that employment or those services; and any claims under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, California Labor Code Section 1400 et seq. or any similar law, which requires, among other things, that advance notice be given of certain work force reductions. This release and waiver does not apply to: (i) the Executive’s rights to receive the compensation and benefits provided for in clauses (1) through (2) of Section 6.2, as applicable, of the Employment Agreement; or (ii) the Executive’s rights under any stock option agreement between the Executive and the Company. Caloz, J. Employment Agreement – 2023 1016/04/2025, 06:37 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 10/12 2. The Executive understands and agrees that he is expressly waiving all rights afforded by Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California (“Section 1542”) with respect to the Releasees. Section 1542 states as follows: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1542, and for the purpose of implementing a full and complete release, the Executive understands and agrees that this General Release is intended to include all claims, if any, which the Executive may have and which he does not now know or suspect to exist in his favor against the Releasees and the Executive understands and agrees that this Agreement extinguishes those claims. 3. Excluded from this General Release and waiver are any claims which cannot be waived by law, including but not limited to the right to participate in an investigation conducted by certain government agencies. The Executive, however, waives the Executive’s right to any monetary recovery should any agency (such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing) pursue any claims on the Executive’s behalf. The Executive represents and warrants that the Executive has not filed any complaint, charge or lawsuit against the Releasees with any government agency or any court. 4. The Executive agrees never to seek personal recovery from Releasees in any forum for any claim covered by the above waiver and release language, except that the Executive may bring a claim under the ADEA to challenge this General Release. Nothing in this General Release is intended to reflect any party’s belief that the Executive’s waiver of claims under ADEA is invalid or unenforceable, it being the intent of the parties that such claims are waived. 5. The Executive acknowledges and recites that: (a) The Executive has executed this General Release knowingly and voluntarily; (b) The Executive has read and understands this General Release in its entirety; Caloz, J. Employment Agreement – 2023 1116/04/2025, 06:37 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 11/12 (c) The Executive acknowledges that he has been advised by his own legal counsel and has sought such other advice as he wishes with respect to the terms of this General Release before executing it; (d) The Executive’s execution of this General Release has not been forced by any the Executive or agent of the Company, and the Executive has had an opportunity to negotiate about the terms of this General Release; and (e) The Executive has not sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed any claim, demand, right, action, suit, cause of action or other interest that is the subject matter of this General Release. 6. This General Release shall be governed by the internal laws (and not the choice of laws) of the State of California, except for the application of preemptive Federal law. 7. The Executive acknowledges that he is waiving his rights under the ADEA and the Older Worker’s Benefit Protection Act and therefore, in compliance with those statutes, acknowledges the following: The Executive acknowledges that he has been provided a minimum of twenty-one calendar days after receipt of this Agreement to consider whether to sign it; The Executive acknowledges that he shall have seven days from the date he executes this General Release to revoke his waiver and release of any ADEA claims only (but not his waiver or release hereunder of other claims) by providing written notice of the revocation to the Company, and that, in the event of such revocation, the provisions of Section 4 or clauses (4) through (6) of Section 6.2, as applicable, of the Employment Agreement shall thereupon become null and void and the Company shall be entitled to a return from the Executive of all payments to the Executive pursuant to such clauses; The Executive acknowledges that this waiver and release does not apply to any rights or claims that may arise under ADEA after the effective date of this Agreement; and The Executive acknowledges that the consideration given in exchange for this waiver and release Agreement is in addition to anything of value to which he was already entitled.

Duties; Place of Employment. The Executive shall perform in a professional and business-like manner, and to the best of his ability, the duties as are customarily performed and exercised by a Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President of a public company and such other duties as are reasonably assigned to him from time to time by the Company’s Chair of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”). The Executive understands and agrees that his duties, title and authority may be changed from time to time in the discretion of the Company’s Chair of the Board. The Executive’s services hereunder shall be rendered from his home office on a virtual basis, except for travel when and as required in the performance of the Executive’s duties hereunder. 3.

The term (the “Term”) of the Executive’s employment hereunder shall commence on the Effective Date and shall expire on December 31, 2025 unless sooner terminated in accordance with Section 6.

Target Bonus. The Executive also shall be eligible for an annual target performance-based bonus for the Executive’s services equal to 40% of the Base Salary during the Term, less applicable payroll deductions and tax withholdings (the “Target Bonus”). Target Bonuses do not constitute a promise of payment and the Executive’s actual bonus, if any, will depend in part on the Company’s performance and the Compensation Committee’s discretion in assessing the Executive’s individual performance in relation to his objectives as determined by the Board and the overall performance and status of the Company. Any Target Bonus payable to the Executive shall be paid with respect to a performance period consistent with the Company’s standard timing for paying such bonuses and in any event no later than February 28th of the calendar year following the calendar year to which the Target Bonus relates. 5.3.

Caloz, J. Employment Agreement – 2023 316/04/2025, 06:37 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 3/12 6.2. Termination by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason. The Company may also terminate the Executive’s employment without Cause upon ten days’ notice to the Executive and the Executive may also terminate the Executive’s employment for Good Reason (as defined below) upon ten days’ written notice to the Company. Upon termination of the Executive’s employment by the Company without Cause or the Executive’s termination of the Executive’s employment for Good Reason, all compensation and benefits to the Executive hereunder shall cease and the Executive shall be entitled to, subject to Section 20, (1) any accrued but unpaid Base Salary and unused vacation as of the date of such termination as required by California law, which shall be due and payable upon the effective date of such termination, (2) any unpaid Target Bonus that may have been awarded to the Executive under Section 5.2 prior to such date, which shall be due and payable in accordance with the Company’s normal payroll policies and procedures or as otherwise required by California law, (3) all of the Executive’s vested stock options and other equity awards as of the date of termination of the Executive’s employment shall remain exercisable for their full term, subject to the terms of the applicable award agreements, (4) retain and have full ownership of all electronic devices provided to the Executive (including, without limitation, a computer, telephone, tablet and printer), provided that all the Company confidential information shall be deleted by the Company from such devices before releasing them to the Executive, (5) a lump sum amount, which shall be due and payable within ten days following the effective date of the Release (as defined above), equal to twelve months of the Executive’s Base Salary as provided in Section 5.1 and an amount equal to the prorated portion of the Target Bonus provided in Section 5.2 for the year in which the termination occurred based on the number of days the Executive was employed, provided, that if such termination occurs within six months prior to or within twelve months following a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined), then the amount described in this clause (5) shall be equal to eighteen months of the Executive’s Base Salary as provided in Section 5.1, and the full Target Bonus amount as provided in Section 5.2, and (6) reimbursement of the Executive and his dependents for a period of twelve months following such termination (eighteen months if such termination occurs within six months prior to or within twelve months following a Change of Control) of all Medicare premiums and the premiums associated with Executive’s continuation of health insurance pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (“COBRA”), as applicable, provided, that the Executive timely elects and is eligible to continue to receive COBRA benefits (less all applicable tax withholdings), payable in accordance with the Company’s usual reimbursement practices and policies in effect from time to time. The Executive’s right to the compensation and benefits provided for in clauses (5) and (6) of this Section shall be conditioned upon the Executive having executed and delivered to the Company the Release, provided that the compensation and benefits shall be paid or commence, as applicable, after the time period for the Executive to execute, return and revoke the Release has expired (and if such time period begins in one taxable year and ends in a second taxable year, no payment shall be made until the first payroll period in the second taxable year). For purposes of this Section 6.2: (a) “Change of Control” shall mean a “change in ownership or effective control of a corporation, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of a corporation,” as applied to the Company, within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and Treas. Reg. §1.409A-3(i)(5). (b) “Good Reason” shall mean any material breach by the Company of the terms hereof that is not corrected by the Company within five days after written notice by the Executive to the Company, including, without limitation, (i) the assignment to the Executive of any duties inconsistent in any respect with his position as the Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President (including status, offices, titles, reporting requirements, authority, duties or responsibilities); or (ii) any failure by the Company to comply with its compensation obligations under this Agreement. If the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason, subject to the Company’s right to cure as set forth above, the termination shall take effect on the effective date of the written notice to the Company (determined under Section 15). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Executive does not terminate his employment for Good Reason within thirty days after the Company’s failure to cure as provided herein, such condition giving rise to a “Good Reason” shall no longer constitute Good Reason for the Executive to terminate his employment.

In the event of the Executive’s death or “Disability” (as defined below) during the Term, the Executive’s employment shall automatically cease and terminate as of the date of the Executive’s death or the effective date of the Company’s written notice to the Executive of its decision to terminate his employment by reason of his Disability, as the case may be, and the Executive or his heirs or personal representative shall be entitled to the same payments and benefits, at the same times, as described in Section 6.2 for a termination of employment by the Company without Cause and all of the Executive’s stock options and any other equity awards based on the Company securities held by the Executive at the time of his death or Disability shall immediately vest in full and shall remain exercisable thereafter for their full term. In addition, the Executive or his heirs or personal representative shall be entitled to retain and have full ownership of all electronic devices provided to the Executive (including, without limitation, a computer, telephone and tablet); provided that all the Company confidential information shall be deleted by the Company from such devices before releasing them to the Executive or such heirs or personal representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision of Section 6.2, the Company’s obligation to pay the Executive the Base Salary provided in Section 6.2 for the severance period following termination of his employment by reason of his Disability shall be subject to offset and shall be reduced by any and all amounts paid to the Executive under any disability insurance policy paid or provided for by the Company as provided in Section 5.5 or otherwise. The Executive’s “Disability” shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in any policy of disability insurance maintained by the Company (or by the Executive, as the case may be) with respect to the Executive or, if no such policy is then in effect, shall mean the Executive’s inability to fully perform his duties hereunder for any period of at least 75 consecutive days or for a total of 90 days, whether or not consecutive. 7. Confidentiality.

Upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Executive’s employment with the Company, or upon request by the Company, the Executive shall deliver to the Company all such documents belonging to the Company, including any and all copies in the Executive’s possession or under the Executive’s control. 8. Equitable Remedies; Injunctive Relief. The Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees that monetary damages are inadequate to fully compensate the Company for the damages that would result from a breach or threatened breach of Section 7 of this Agreement and, accordingly, that the Company shall be entitled to equitable remedies, including, without limitation, specific performance, temporary restraining orders, and preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions, to enforce such Section without the necessity of proving actual damages in connection therewith. This provision shall not, however, diminish the Company’s right to claim and recover damages or enforce any other of its legal or equitable rights or defenses. Caloz, J.

Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the Company, its successors and assigns and the Executive and his heirs and representatives; provided, that this Agreement may be assigned by the Company to a successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company. 12. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and the parties hereto have made no agreements, representations or warranties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement that are not set forth otherwise herein. This Agreement supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements, written or oral, between the Executive and the Company relating to the subject matter hereof. Any such prior or contemporaneous agreements are hereby terminated and of no further effect, and the Executive, by the execution hereof, agrees that any compensation provided for under any such agreements is specifically superseded and replaced by the provisions of this Agreement. 13. Amendment. No modification of this Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by the parties hereto and unless such writing is made by an executive officer of the Company (other than the Executive). The parties hereto agree that in no event shall an oral modification of this Agreement be enforceable or valid. 14. Governing Law.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the Executive and the Company agree as follows: 1. The Executive, for himself, his spouse, heirs, administrators, children, representatives, executors, successors, assigns, and all other persons claiming through the Executive, if any (collectively, “Releasers”), does hereby release, waive, and forever discharge the Company and each of its agents, subsidiaries, parents, affiliates, related organizations, executives, officers, directors, attorneys, successors, and assigns (collectively, the “Releasees”) from, and does fully waive any obligations of Releasees to Releasers for, any and all liability, actions, charges, causes of action, obligations, demands, damages, or claims for relief, remuneration, sums of money, accounts or expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs) of any kind whatsoever, whether known or unknown or contingent or absolute, which heretofore has been or which hereafter may be suffered or sustained, directly or indirectly, by Releasers in consequence of, arising out of, or in any way relating to: (a) the Executive’s employment with and services to the Company or any of its affiliates; (b) the termination of the Executive’s employment with and services to the Company and any of its affiliates; or (c) any event whatsoever occurring on or prior to the date of this General Release. The foregoing release and discharge, waiver and covenant not to sue includes, but is not limited to, all claims and any obligations or causes of action arising from such claims, under common law including, but not limited to, wrongful or retaliatory discharge, breach of contract (including but not limited to any claims under any employment agreement between the Executive, on the one hand, and the Company or its affiliates, on the other hand) and any action arising in tort including, but not limited to, libel, slander, defamation or intentional infliction of emotional distress, and claims under any federal, state or local statute including the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and 1871 (42 U.S.C. § 1981), the National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the California Family Rights Act or the discrimination or employment laws of any state or municipality, and any claims under any express or implied contract which Releasers may claim existed with Releasees. This also includes, but is not limited to, a release of any claims for wrongful discharge and all claims for alleged physical or personal injury, emotional distress relating to or arising out of the Executive’s employment with or services to the Company or any of its affiliates or the termination of that employment or those services; and any claims under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, California Labor Code Section 1400 et seq. or any similar law, which requires, among other things, that advance notice be given of certain work force reductions. This release and waiver does not apply to: (i) the Executive’s rights to receive the compensation and benefits provided for in clauses (1) through (2) of Section 6.2, as applicable, of the Employment Agreement; or (ii) the Executive’s rights under any stock option agreement between the Executive and the Company. Caloz, J. Employment Agreement – 2023 1016/04/2025, 06:37 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 10/12 2. The Executive understands and agrees that he is expressly waiving all rights afforded by Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California (“Section 1542”) with respect to the Releasees. Section 1542 states as follows: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1542, and for the purpose of implementing a full and complete release, the Executive understands and agrees that this General Release is intended to include all claims, if any, which the Executive may have and which he does not now know or suspect to exist in his favor against the Releasees and the Executive understands and agrees that this Agreement extinguishes those claims. 3. Excluded from this General Release and waiver are any claims which cannot be waived by law, including but not limited to the right to participate in an investigation conducted by certain government agencies. The Executive, however, waives the Executive’s right to any monetary recovery should any agency (such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing) pursue any claims on the Executive’s behalf. The Executive represents and warrants that the Executive has not filed any complaint, charge or lawsuit against the Releasees with any government agency or any court. 4. The Executive agrees never to seek personal recovery from Releasees in any forum for any claim covered by the above waiver and release language, except that the Executive may bring a claim under the ADEA to challenge this General Release. Nothing in this General Release is intended to reflect any party’s belief that the Executive’s waiver of claims under ADEA is invalid or unenforceable, it being the intent of the parties that such claims are waived. 5. The Executive acknowledges and recites that: (a) The Executive has executed this General Release knowingly and voluntarily; (b) The Executive has read and understands this General Release in its entirety; Caloz, J. Employment Agreement – 2023 1116/04/2025, 06:37 mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1037496 11/12 (c) The Executive acknowledges that he has been advised by his own legal counsel and has sought such other advice as he wishes with respect to the terms of this General Release before executing it; (d) The Executive’s execution of this General Release has not been forced by any the Executive or agent of the Company, and the Executive has had an opportunity to negotiate about the terms of this General Release; and (e) The Executive has not sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed any claim, demand, right, action, suit, cause of action or other interest that is the subject matter of this General Release. 6. This General Release shall be governed by the internal laws (and not the choice of laws) of the State of California, except for the application of preemptive Federal law. 7. The Executive acknowledges that he is waiving his rights under the ADEA and the Older Worker’s Benefit Protection Act and therefore, in compliance with those statutes, acknowledges the following: The Executive acknowledges that he has been provided a minimum of twenty-one calendar days after receipt of this Agreement to consider whether to sign it; The Executive acknowledges that he shall have seven days from the date he executes this General Release to revoke his waiver and release of any ADEA claims only (but not his waiver or release hereunder of other claims) by providing written notice of the revocation to the Company, and that, in the event of such revocation, the provisions of Section 4 or clauses (4) through (6) of Section 6.2, as applicable, of the Employment Agreement shall thereupon become null and void and the Company shall be entitled to a return from the Executive of all payments to the Executive pursuant to such clauses; The Executive acknowledges that this waiver and release does not apply to any rights or claims that may arise under ADEA after the effective date of this Agreement; and The Executive acknowledges that the consideration given in exchange for this waiver and release Agreement is in addition to anything of value to which he was already entitled.

In the event the Release does not become effective within the 60-day period following the date of your termination of employment, you will not be entitled to the aforesaid payments and benefits. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” means any of the following: (a) your commission of an act of fraud, embezzlement or dishonesty, or the commission of some other illegal act by you, that has a demonstrable adverse impact on the Company or any successor or affiliate thereof; (b) your conviction of, or plea of “guilty” or “no contest” to, a non-vehicular felony or any crime involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude under the laws of the United States or any state thereof; (c) any intentional, unauthorized use or disclosure by you of confidential information or trade secrets of the Company or any successor or affiliate thereof; (d) your gross negligence, insubordination or material violation of any duty of loyalty to the Company or any successor or affiliate thereof, or any other demonstrable material misconduct on your part; (e) your ongoing and repeated failure or refusal to perform or neglect of your duties as required by this Agreement or your ongoing and repeated failure or refusal to comply with the lawful instructions given to you by the Board, which failure, refusal or neglect continues for 15 days following your receipt of written notice from the Board stating with specificity the nature of such failure, refusal or neglect; provided that it is understood that this clause (e) shall not permit the Company to terminate your employment for Cause solely because of (i) your failure to meet specified performance objectives or achieve a specific result or outcome, or (ii) Company’s dissatisfaction with the quality of services provided by you in the good faith performance of your duties to the Company; or (f) your willful, material breach of any material Company policy or any material provision of this Agreement or the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement. Prior to the 6 |US-DOCS\\\\138581475.1||16/04/2025, 06:43 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036019 6/15 determination that “Cause” under clauses (d), (e) or (f) has occurred, the Company shall (i) provide to you in writing, in reasonable detail, the reasons for the determination that such “Cause” exists, (ii) other than with respect to clause (e) above which specifies the applicable period of time for you to remedy your breach, afford you a reasonable opportunity to remedy any such breach, (iii) provide you an opportunity to be heard prior to the final decision to terminate your employment hereunder for such “Cause” and (iv) make any decision that such “Cause” exists in good faith. The foregoing definition shall not in any way preclude or restrict the right of the Company or any successor or affiliate thereof to discharge or dismiss you for any other acts or omissions, but such other acts or omissions shall not be deemed, for purposes of this Agreement, to constitute grounds for termination for Cause. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Change in Control” shall mean (a) a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any other corporation or other entity or person, (b) a sale, lease, exchange or other transfer in one transaction or a series of related transactions of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, or (c) any other transaction, including the sale by the Company of new shares of its capital stock or a transfer of existing shares of capital stock of the Company, the result of which is that a third party that is not an affiliate of the Company or its stockholders (or a group of third parties not affiliated with the Company or its stockholders) immediately prior to such transaction acquires or holds capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the Company’s outstanding voting power immediately following such transaction; provided that the following events shall not constitute a “Change in Control”: (i) a transaction (other than a sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets) in which the holders of the voting securities of the Company immediately prior to the merger or consolidation hold, directly or indirectly, at least a majority of the voting securities in the successor corporation or its parent immediately after the merger or consolidation; (ii) a sale, lease, exchange or other transaction in one transaction or a series of related transactions of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to an affiliate of the Company; (iii) an initial public offering of any of the Company’s securities or any other transaction or series of related transactions principally for bona fide equity financing purposes; (iv) a reincorporation of the Company solely to change its jurisdiction; or (v) a transaction undertaken for the primary purpose of creating a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same proportion by the persons who held the Company’s securities immediately before such transaction. If a Change in Control would give rise to a payment or settlement event with respect to any payment or benefit that constitutes “nonqualified deferred compensation,” the transaction or event constituting the Change in Control must also constitute a “change in control event” (as defined in Treasury Regulation §1.409A-3(i)(5)) in order to give rise to the payment or settlement event for such payment or benefit, to the extent required by Section 409A. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Change in Control Period” means the 24 months following a Change in Control. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason” means any of the following without your written consent: (a) a material diminution in your authority, duties or 7 |US-DOCS\\\\138581475.1||16/04/2025, 06:43 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036019 7/15 responsibilities; (b) a material diminution in your base compensation (and you and the Company agree that any diminution of 10% or more shall be considered material for this purpose, regardless of whether such diminution occurs due to a single reduction or a series of reductions in your base compensation), unless such a reduction is imposed across-the-board to senior management of the Company; (c) a material change in the geographic location at which you must perform your duties (and you and the Company agree that a relocation of the geographic location at which you must perform your duties to a location that increases your one-way commute from your residence by more than 50 miles as compared to your principal place of employment prior to such relocation shall be considered material for this purpose); or (d) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company or any successor or affiliate of its obligations to you under this Agreement. You must provide written notice to the Company of the occurrence of any of the foregoing events or conditions without your written consent within 60 days of the occurrence of such event. The Company or any successor or affiliate shall have a period of 30 days to cure such event or condition after receipt of written notice of such event from you. Your termination of employment by reason of resignation from employment with the Company for Good Reason must occur within 30 days following the expiration of the foregoing 30-day cure period. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Stock Awards” means all stock options, restricted stock and such other awards granted pursuant to the Company’s stock option and equity incentive award plans or agreements and any shares of stock issued upon exercise thereof. o To the extent applicable, this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder. The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with, or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance with such intention. To the extent that any provision in this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with or exemption from Section 409A of the Code, the provision shall be read in such a manner that no payments payable under this Agreement shall be subject to an “additional tax” as defined in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, any right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. For purposes of this Agreement, all references to your “termination of employment” shall mean your “separation from service” (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)) (“Separation from Service”). If you are a “specified employee” (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), as determined by the Company in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, on the date of your Separation from Service, to the extent that the payments or benefits under this Agreement are “non-qualified deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code and the delayed payment or distribution of all or any portion of such amounts to which you are entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then such portion deferred pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid or distributed to 8 |US-DOCS\\\\138581475.1||16/04/2025, 06:43 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036019 8/15 you in a lump sum on the earlier of (a) the date that is 6 months and one day following your Separation from Service, (b) the date of your death or (c) the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code. Any remaining payments due under this Agreement shall be paid as otherwise provided herein. o To the extent that the payments or benefits under this Agreement are “non- qualified deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code, if the period during which you may deliver the Release required hereunder spans two calendar years, the payment of your post- termination benefits shall occur (or commence) on the later of (a) January 1 of the second calendar year, or (b) the first regularly-scheduled payroll date following the date your Release becomes effective. o Any reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits payable under this Agreement shall be made in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv) and shall be paid on or before the last day of your taxable year following the taxable year in which you incurred the expenses. The amount of expenses reimbursed or in-kind benefits payable in one year shall not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits payable in any other taxable year of yours, and your right to reimbursement for such amounts shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. • COMP ANY P OLICIES A ND P ROPRIET ARY I NFO RMA TION AND I NVENTIONS A SSIGNMENT A GREEMENT . As an employee of the Company, you shall be expected to abide by all of the Company’s policies and procedures and the Company’s employee handbook, if any. You and the Company have entered into a Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement, attached hereto as Exhibit A, which shall survive termination of your employment with the Company and the termination of the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement. You reaffirm your obligations under the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement and acknowledge that a remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement would be inadequate, and you therefore agree that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief in case of any such breach or threatened breach. Any references in your Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement to the Prior Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to refer to this Agreement. The Company may modify, revoke, suspend or terminate any of the terms, plans, policies and/or procedures described in the employee handbook, if any, or as otherwise communicated to you, in whole or part, at any time, with or without notice. • BEST P AY P ROVISION . oIn the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by you pursuant to the terms of any plan, arrangement or agreement (including any payment or benefit received in connection with a change in ownership or control or the termination of your employment) (all such payments and benefits being hereinafter referred to as the “Total Payments”) would be subject (in whole or part) to the excise tax (the “Excise Tax”) imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, then the Total Payments shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax but only if (i) the net amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced (after subtracting the amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions 9 |US-DOCS\\\\138581475.1||16/04/2025, 06:43 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036019 9/15 attributable to such reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (ii) the net amount of such Total Payments without such reduction (after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax to which you would be subject in respect of such unreduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such unreduced Total Payments). Except to the extent that an alternative reduction order would result in a greater economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis, the parties intend that the Total Payments shall be reduced in the following order: (w) reduction of any cash severance payments otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (x) reduction of any other cash payments or benefits otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (y) reduction of any other payments or benefits otherwise payable to you on a pro-rata basis or such other manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting and payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and (z) reduction of any payments attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code; provided, in case of clauses (x), (y) and (z), that reduction of any payments or benefits attributable to the acceleration of vesting of Company equity awards shall be first applied to equity awards with later vesting dates; provided, further, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such reduction shall be undertaken in a manner that complies with and does not result in the imposition of additional taxes on you under Section 409A of the Code. The foregoing reductions shall be made in a manner that results in the maximum economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis and, to the extent economically equivalent payments or benefits are subject to reduction, in a pro rata manner. oAll determinations regarding the application of the paragraph above shall be made by an independent accounting firm or consulting group with nationally recognized standing and substantial expertise and experience in performing calculations regarding the applicability of Section 280G of the Code and the Excise Tax retained by the Company prior to the date of the applicable change in ownership or control (the “280G Firm”). For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which (x) does not constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, or (y) constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the “base amount” (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such reasonable compensation, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which you shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a “payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account, and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the 280G Firm in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. All determinations related to the calculations to be performed pursuant to this “Best Pay Provision” section shall be done by the 280G Firm. The 280G Firm will be directed to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both you and the Company within fifteen (15) days after notification from 10 |US-DOCS\\\\138581475.1||16/04/2025, 06:43 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036019 10/15 either the Company or you that you may receive payments which may be “parachute payments.” You and the Company will each provide the 280G Firm access to and copies of any books, records, and documents as may be reasonably requested by the 280G Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the 280G Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the 280G Firm for its services in connection with the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement will be borne solely by the Company. • EMPLOYMENT T ERMS .

You represent and agree that your performance of your duties for the Company shall not violate any agreements, obligations or understandings that you may have with any third party or prior employer.

You agree not to make any unauthorized disclosure or use, on behalf of the Company, of any confidential information belonging to any of your former employers. You also represent that you are not in unauthorized possession of any materials containing a third party’s confidential and proprietary information. While employed by the Company, you will not engage in any business activity in competition with the Company nor make preparations to do so. In the event that you wish to undertake a business activity outside the scope of your employment by the Company, which activity you believe entails no conflict with the Company’s activities, you agree to inform the Company of your intentions before the initiation of such outside business activity, and you furthermore agree to abide by the Company’s decision as to whether or not there is no conflict. If, in the Company’s sole determination, a conflict exists or is likely to develop, you agree not to undertake such outside business activity. • AT- WILL E MPLOYMENT . Your employment with the Company will be “at-will” at all times, including after your introductory, probationary period, meaning that either you or the Company will be entitled to terminate your employment at any time and for any reason, with or without cause. Any contrary representations that may have been made to you are superseded by this offer. This Agreement in no way represents a fixed-term employment contract. This is the full and complete agreement between you and the Company on this term. Although your job duties, title, compensation and benefits, as well as the Company’s personnel policies and procedures, may change from time to time, the “at will” nature of your employment may only be changed in an express written agreement signed by you and a duly authorized officer of the Company. • NON-I NTERFERENCE . While employed by the Company, and for one (1) year immediately following the date on which you terminate employment or otherwise cease providing services to the Company, you agree not to interfere with the business of the Company by (a) soliciting or attempting to solicit any employee or consultant of the Company to terminate such employee’s or consultant’s employment or service in order to become an employee, consultant or independent contractor to or for any other person or entity or (b) soliciting or attempting to solicit any vendor, supplier, customer or other person or entity either directly or indirectly, to direct his, her or its purchase of the Company’s products and/or services to any person, firm, corporation, institution or other entity in competition with the business of the Company. The foregoing restrictions shall not apply with respect to the bona fide hiring and firing of Company personnel to the extent such acts are part of your duties for Company. Your duties under this 11 |US-DOCS\\\\138581475.1||16/04/2025, 06:43 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036019 11/15 paragraph shall survive termination of your employment with the Company and the termination of this Agreement. • REASONABLENESS OF T ERMS . You agree that the terms contained in the “Other Agreements” and “Non- Interference” paragraphs above are reasonable in all respects and that the restrictions contained therein are designed to protect the Company against unfair competition. In the event a court determines that any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement are unreasonable, the court may limit the application of any provision or term, or modify any provision or term, and proceed to enforce this Agreement as so limited or modified. • GOVERNING L AW ; J URISDICTION AND V ENUE . This Agreement, for all purposes, shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to conflicts-of-law principles. Any action or proceeding by either party to enforce this Agreement shall be brought only in any state or federal court located in Boston, Massachusetts. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and waive the defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding in such venue. • SEVERABILITY . Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or any other jurisdiction, but this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never been contained herein. • SUCCESSORS AND A SSIGNS . This Agreement is intended to bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by you and the Company, and their respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors and administrators, except that you may not assign any of your duties hereunder and you may not assign any of your rights hereunder, without the written consent of the Company, which shall not be withheld unreasonably. • ENTIRE A GREEMENT . This Agreement and the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement constitute the complete, final and exclusive embodiment of the entire agreement between you and the Company with respect to the terms and conditions of your employment specified herein and therein.

All prior discussions and negotiations have been and are merged and integrated into, and are superseded by, this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Prior Agreement.

The foregoing definition shall not in any way preclude or restrict the right of the Company or any successor or affiliate thereof to discharge or dismiss you for any other acts or omissions, but such other acts or omissions shall not be deemed, for purposes of this Agreement, to constitute grounds for termination for Cause. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Change in Control” shall mean (a) a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any other corporation or other entity or person, (b) a sale, lease, exchange or other transfer in one transaction or a series of related transactions of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, or (c) any other transaction, including the sale by the Company of new shares of its capital stock or a transfer of existing shares of capital stock of the Company, the result of which is that a third party that is not an affiliate of the Company or its stockholders (or a group of third parties not affiliated with the Company or its stockholders) immediately prior to such transaction acquires or holds capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the Company’s outstanding voting power immediately following such transaction; provided that the following events shall not constitute a “Change in Control”: (i) a transaction (other than a sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets) in which the holders of the voting securities of the Company immediately prior to the merger or consolidation hold, directly or indirectly, at least a majority of the voting securities in the successor corporation or its parent immediately after the merger or consolidation; (ii) a sale, lease, exchange or other transaction in one transaction or a series of related transactions of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to an affiliate of the Company; (iii) an initial public offering of any of the Company’s securities or any other transaction or series of related transactions principally for bona fide equity financing purposes; (iv) a reincorporation of the Company solely to change its jurisdiction; or (v) a transaction undertaken for the primary purpose of creating a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same proportion by the persons who held the Company’s securities immediately before such transaction. If a Change in Control would give rise to a payment or settlement event with respect to any payment or benefit that constitutes “nonqualified deferred compensation,” the transaction or event constituting the Change in Control must also constitute a “change in control event” (as defined in Treasury Regulation §1.409A-3(i)(5)) in order to give rise to the payment or settlement event for such payment or benefit, to the extent required by Section 409A. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Change in Control Period” means the 24 months following a Change in Control. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason” means any of the following without your written consent: (a) a material diminution in your authority, duties or 7 |US-DOCS\\\\138581475.1||16/04/2025, 06:43 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036019 7/15 responsibilities; (b) a material diminution in your base compensation (and you and the Company agree that any diminution of 10% or more shall be considered material for this purpose, regardless of whether such diminution occurs due to a single reduction or a series of reductions in your base compensation), unless such a reduction is imposed across-the-board to senior management of the Company; (c) a material change in the geographic location at which you must perform your duties (and you and the Company agree that a relocation of the geographic location at which you must perform your duties to a location that increases your one-way commute from your residence by more than 50 miles as compared to your principal place of employment prior to such relocation shall be considered material for this purpose); or (d) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company or any successor or affiliate of its obligations to you under this Agreement. You must provide written notice to the Company of the occurrence of any of the foregoing events or conditions without your written consent within 60 days of the occurrence of such event. The Company or any successor or affiliate shall have a period of 30 days to cure such event or condition after receipt of written notice of such event from you.

The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with, or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance with such intention. To the extent that any provision in this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with or exemption from Section 409A of the Code, the provision shall be read in such a manner that no payments payable under this Agreement shall be subject to an “additional tax” as defined in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, any right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. For purposes of this Agreement, all references to your “termination of employment” shall mean your “separation from service” (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)) (“Separation from Service”). If you are a “specified employee” (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), as determined by the Company in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, on the date of your Separation from Service, to the extent that the payments or benefits under this Agreement are “non-qualified deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code and the delayed payment or distribution of all or any portion of such amounts to which you are entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then such portion deferred pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid or distributed to 8 |US-DOCS\\\\138581475.1||16/04/2025, 06:43 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036019 8/15 you in a lump sum on the earlier of (a) the date that is 6 months and one day following your Separation from Service, (b) the date of your death or (c) the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code. Any remaining payments due under this Agreement shall be paid as otherwise provided herein. o To the extent that the payments or benefits under this Agreement are “non- qualified deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code, if the period during which you may deliver the Release required hereunder spans two calendar years, the payment of your post- termination benefits shall occur (or commence) on the later of (a) January 1 of the second calendar year, or (b) the first regularly-scheduled payroll date following the date your Release becomes effective. o Any reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits payable under this Agreement shall be made in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv) and shall be paid on or before the last day of your taxable year following the taxable year in which you incurred the expenses. The amount of expenses reimbursed or in-kind benefits payable in one year shall not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits payable in any other taxable year of yours, and your right to reimbursement for such amounts shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. • COMP ANY P OLICIES A ND P ROPRIET ARY I NFO RMA TION AND I NVENTIONS A SSIGNMENT A GREEMENT . As an employee of the Company, you shall be expected to abide by all of the Company’s policies and procedures and the Company’s employee handbook, if any. You and the Company have entered into a Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement, attached hereto as Exhibit A, which shall survive termination of your employment with the Company and the termination of the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement. You reaffirm your obligations under the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement and acknowledge that a remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement would be inadequate, and you therefore agree that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief in case of any such breach or threatened breach. Any references in your Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement to the Prior Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to refer to this Agreement. The Company may modify, revoke, suspend or terminate any of the terms, plans, policies and/or procedures described in the employee handbook, if any, or as otherwise communicated to you, in whole or part, at any time, with or without notice. • BEST P AY P ROVISION . oIn the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by you pursuant to the terms of any plan, arrangement or agreement (including any payment or benefit received in connection with a change in ownership or control or the termination of your employment) (all such payments and benefits being hereinafter referred to as the “Total Payments”) would be subject (in whole or part) to the excise tax (the “Excise Tax”) imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, then the Total Payments shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax but only if (i) the net amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced (after subtracting the amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions 9 |US-DOCS\\\\138581475.1||16/04/2025, 06:43 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036019 9/15 attributable to such reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (ii) the net amount of such Total Payments without such reduction (after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax to which you would be subject in respect of such unreduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such unreduced Total Payments). Except to the extent that an alternative reduction order would result in a greater economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis, the parties intend that the Total Payments shall be reduced in the following order: (w) reduction of any cash severance payments otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (x) reduction of any other cash payments or benefits otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (y) reduction of any other payments or benefits otherwise payable to you on a pro-rata basis or such other manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting and payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and (z) reduction of any payments attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code; provided, in case of clauses (x), (y) and (z), that reduction of any payments or benefits attributable to the acceleration of vesting of Company equity awards shall be first applied to equity awards with later vesting dates; provided, further, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such reduction shall be undertaken in a manner that complies with and does not result in the imposition of additional taxes on you under Section 409A of the Code. The foregoing reductions shall be made in a manner that results in the maximum economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis and, to the extent economically equivalent payments or benefits are subject to reduction, in a pro rata manner. oAll determinations regarding the application of the paragraph above shall be made by an independent accounting firm or consulting group with nationally recognized standing and substantial expertise and experience in performing calculations regarding the applicability of Section 280G of the Code and the Excise Tax retained by the Company prior to the date of the applicable change in ownership or control (the “280G Firm”). For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which (x) does not constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, or (y) constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the “base amount” (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such reasonable compensation, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which you shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a “payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account, and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the 280G Firm in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. All determinations related to the calculations to be performed pursuant to this “Best Pay Provision” section shall be done by the 280G Firm. The 280G Firm will be directed to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both you and the Company within fifteen (15) days after notification from 10 |US-DOCS\\\\138581475.1||16/04/2025, 06:43 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036019 10/15 either the Company or you that you may receive payments which may be “parachute payments.” You and the Company will each provide the 280G Firm access to and copies of any books, records, and documents as may be reasonably requested by the 280G Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the 280G Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the 280G Firm for its services in connection with the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement will be borne solely by the Company. • EMPLOYMENT T ERMS .

You agree not to make any unauthorized disclosure or use, on behalf of the Company, of any confidential information belonging to any of your former employers. You also represent that you are not in unauthorized possession of any materials containing a third party’s confidential and proprietary information. While employed by the Company, you will not engage in any business activity in competition with the Company nor make preparations to do so. In the event that you wish to undertake a business activity outside the scope of your employment by the Company, which activity you believe entails no conflict with the Company’s activities, you agree to inform the Company of your intentions before the initiation of such outside business activity, and you furthermore agree to abide by the Company’s decision as to whether or not there is no conflict. If, in the Company’s sole determination, a conflict exists or is likely to develop, you agree not to undertake such outside business activity. • AT- WILL E MPLOYMENT . Your employment with the Company will be “at-will” at all times, including after your introductory, probationary period, meaning that either you or the Company will be entitled to terminate your employment at any time and for any reason, with or without cause. Any contrary representations that may have been made to you are superseded by this offer. This Agreement in no way represents a fixed-term employment contract. This is the full and complete agreement between you and the Company on this term. Although your job duties, title, compensation and benefits, as well as the Company’s personnel policies and procedures, may change from time to time, the “at will” nature of your employment may only be changed in an express written agreement signed by you and a duly authorized officer of the Company. • NON-I NTERFERENCE .

You shall be solely responsible for all matters relating to continuation of coverage pursuant to COBRA, including, without limitation, the election of such coverage and the timely payment of premiums. You shall notify the Company immediately if you become eligible to receive the equivalent or increased healthcare coverage by means of subsequent employment or self- employment; and ▪ Notwithstanding anything else set forth herein, in the Company’s equity plan or in any award agreement, any unvested Stock Awards then held by you will vest on the effective date of your Release. The foregoing provisions are hereby deemed to be a part of each Stock Award and to supersede any less favorable provision in any agreement or plan regarding such Stock Award, and shall be in addition to the accelerated vesting of the Founders’ Shares under the Stock Restriction Agreement. o O THER AGREEMENTS . If your employment terminates for any reason after December 31, 2023, other than by the Company for Cause or as a result of your death or following your Disability (as defined in the Stock Restriction Agreement), you will immediately become a consultant to the Company pursuant to the consulting agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Consulting Agreement”), and there will be no break in service for purposes of your Stock Awards or Founders’ Shares. If the Company does not enter into the Consulting Agreement for any reason and you experience an interruption in service to the Company following your termination of employment, such termination will be deemed to be a Qualifying Termination for purposes of the Stock Restriction Agreement entitling you to full vesting of any unvested Founders’ Shares on the date of such termination (but, for the avoidance of doubt, there will be no accelerated vesting of any Stock Awards unless your termination of employment constitutes a Qualifying Termination 5 |US-DOCS\\\\138338525.3||16/04/2025, 06:44 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036018 5/17 under this Agreement). In addition, upon a termination of your employment or a termination of your service under the Consulting Agreement due to your death or following your Disability, any unvested Founders’ Shares will vest in full on the date of your termination (but, for the avoidance of doubt, there will be no accelerated vesting of any Stock Awards due to your death or following your Disability). The foregoing provisions are hereby deemed to be a part of each Stock Award and to supersede any less favorable provision in any agreement or plan governing such Stock Award, and shall be in addition to the accelerated vesting of the Founders’ Shares under the Stock Restriction Agreement or the Consulting Agreement. This Agreement amends the Stock Restriction Agreement to the extent the provisions contained herein are more favorable than those contained in the Stock Restriction Agreement. o As a condition to your receipt of any post-termination payments and benefits pursuant to the preceding paragraphs, you shall execute and not revoke a separation agreement containing a release of all claims in favor of the Company, a post-termination non-competition covenant generally consistent with Section 6.1(a) of the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement, and other customary terms (the “Release”), in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company in order to effectuate a valid general release of claims. In the event the Release does not become effective within the 60-day period following the date of your termination of employment, you will not be entitled to the aforesaid payments and benefits. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” means any of the following: (a) your commission of an act of fraud, embezzlement or dishonesty, or the commission of some other illegal act by you, that has a demonstrable adverse impact on the Company or any successor or affiliate thereof; (b) your conviction of, or plea of “guilty” or “no contest” to, a non-vehicular felony or any crime involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude under the laws of the United States or any state thereof; (c) any intentional, unauthorized use or disclosure by you of confidential information or trade secrets of the Company or any successor or affiliate thereof; (d) your gross negligence, insubordination or material violation of any duty of loyalty to the Company or any successor or affiliate thereof, or any other demonstrable material misconduct on your part; (e) your ongoing and repeated failure or refusal to perform or neglect of your duties as required by this Agreement or your ongoing and repeated failure or refusal to comply with the reasonable and lawful instructions given to you by the Board, which failure, refusal or neglect continues for 15 days following your receipt of written notice from the Board stating with specificity the nature of such failure, refusal or neglect; provided that it is understood that this clause (e) shall not permit the Company to terminate your employment for Cause solely because of (i) your failure to meet specified performance objectives or achieve a specific result or outcome, or (ii) Company’s dissatisfaction with the quality of services provided by you in the good faith performance of your duties to the Company; or (f) your willful, material breach of any material Company policy or any material provision of this Agreement or the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement. Prior to the determination that “Cause” under clauses 6 |US-DOCS\\\\138338525.3||16/04/2025, 06:44 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036018 6/17 (d), (e) or (f) has occurred, the Company shall (i) provide to you in writing, in reasonable detail, the reasons for the determination that such “Cause” exists, (ii) other than with respect to clause (e) above which specifies the applicable period of time for you to remedy your breach, afford you a reasonable opportunity to remedy any such breach, (iii) provide you an opportunity to be heard prior to the final decision to terminate your employment hereunder for such “Cause” and (iv) make any decision that such “Cause” exists in good faith. The foregoing definition shall not in any way preclude or restrict the right of the Company or any successor or affiliate thereof to discharge or dismiss you for any other acts or omissions, but such other acts or omissions shall not be deemed, for purposes of this Agreement, to constitute grounds for termination for Cause. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Change in Control” shall mean (a) a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any other corporation or other entity or person, (b) a sale, lease, exchange or other transfer in one transaction or a series of related transactions of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, or (c) any other transaction, including the sale by the Company of new shares of its capital stock or a transfer of existing shares of capital stock of the Company, the result of which is that a third party that is not an affiliate of the Company or its stockholders (or a group of third parties not affiliated with the Company or its stockholders) immediately prior to such transaction acquires or holds capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the Company’s outstanding voting power immediately following such transaction; provided that the following events shall not constitute a “Change in Control”: (i) a transaction (other than a sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets) in which the holders of the voting securities of the Company immediately prior to the merger or consolidation hold, directly or indirectly, at least a majority of the voting securities in the successor corporation or its parent immediately after the merger or consolidation; (ii) a sale, lease, exchange or other transaction in one transaction or a series of related transactions of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to an affiliate of the Company; (iii) an initial public offering of any of the Company’s securities or any other transaction or series of related transactions principally for bona fide equity financing purposes; (iv) a reincorporation of the Company solely to change its jurisdiction; or (v) a transaction undertaken for the primary purpose of creating a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same proportion by the persons who held the Company’s securities immediately before such transaction. If a Change in Control would give rise to a payment or settlement event with respect to any payment or benefit that constitutes “nonqualified deferred compensation,” the transaction or event constituting the Change in Control must also constitute a “change in control event” (as defined in Treasury Regulation §1.409A-3(i)(5)) in order to give rise to the payment or settlement event for such payment or benefit, to the extent required by Section 409A. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Change in Control Period” means the 24 months following a Change in Control. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason” means any of the following without your written consent: (a) a material diminution in your authority, duties 7 |US-DOCS\\\\138338525.3||16/04/2025, 06:44 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036018 7/17 or responsibilities, including a requirement that you report to a corporate officer other than the Chief Executive Officer; (b) a material diminution in your base compensation (and you and the Company agree that any diminution of 10% or more shall be considered material for this purpose, regardless of whether such diminution occurs due to a single reduction or a series of reductions in your base compensation), unless such a reduction is imposed across- the-board to senior management of the Company; (c) a material change in the geographic location at which you must perform your duties (and you and the Company agree that a relocation of the geographic location at which you must perform your duties to a location that increases your one-way commute from your residence by more than 50 miles as compared to your principal place of employment prior to such relocation shall be considered material for this purpose); or (d) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company or any successor or affiliate of its obligations to you under this Agreement or the Stock Restriction Agreement. You must provide written notice to the Company of the occurrence of any of the foregoing events or conditions without your written consent within 6 months of the occurrence of such event. The Company or any successor or affiliate shall have a period of 30 days to cure such event or condition after receipt of written notice of such event from you. Your termination of employment by reason of resignation from employment with the Company for Good Reason must occur within 30 days following the expiration of the foregoing 30-day cure period. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Stock Awards” means all stock options, restricted stock and such other awards granted pursuant to the Company’s stock option and equity incentive award plans or agreements and any shares of stock issued upon exercise thereof, in each case, granted on or after January 1, 2023. In no event will Stock Awards include those shares (the “Founders’ Shares”) the vesting of which is governed by that certain Stock Restriction Agreement dated February 8, 2021, between you and the Company (the “Stock Restriction Agreement”). For the avoidance of doubt, your Qualifying Termination under this Agreement shall constitute a Qualifying Termination for purposes of the Stock Restriction Agreement. o To the extent applicable, this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder. The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with, or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance with such intention. To the extent that any provision in this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with or exemption from Section 409A of the Code, the provision shall be read in such a manner that no payments payable under this Agreement shall be subject to an “additional tax” as defined in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, any right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. For purposes of this Agreement, all references to your “termination of employment” shall mean your “separation from service” (as defined in 8 |US-DOCS\\\\138338525.3||16/04/2025, 06:44 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036018 8/17 Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)) (“Separation from Service”). If you are a “specified employee” (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), as determined by the Company in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, on the date of your Separation from Service, to the extent that the payments or benefits under this Agreement are “non-qualified deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code and the delayed payment or distribution of all or any portion of such amounts to which you are entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2) (B)(i) of the Code, then such portion deferred pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid or distributed to you in a lump sum on the earlier of (a) the date that is 6 months and one day following your Separation from Service, (b) the date of your death or (c) the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code. Any remaining payments due under this Agreement shall be paid as otherwise provided herein. o To the extent that the payments or benefits under this Agreement are “non- qualified deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code, if the period during which you may deliver the Release required hereunder spans two calendar years, the payment of your post- termination benefits shall occur (or commence) on the later of (a) January 1 of the second calendar year, or (b) the first regularly-scheduled payroll date following the date your Release becomes effective. o Any reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits payable under this Agreement shall be made in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv) and shall be paid on or before the last day of your taxable year following the taxable year in which you incurred the expenses. The amount of expenses reimbursed or in-kind benefits payable in one year shall not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits payable in any other taxable year of yours, and your right to reimbursement for such amounts shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. •COMP ANY P OLICIES A ND P ROPRIET ARY I NFORMA TION AND I NVENTIONS A SSIGNMENT A GREEMENT . As an employee of the Company, you shall be expected to abide by all of the Company’s policies and procedures and the Company’s employee handbook, if any. You and the Company have entered into a Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement, attached hereto as Exhibit B, which shall survive termination of your employment with the Company and the termination of the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement. You reaffirm your obligations under the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement and acknowledge that a remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement would be inadequate, and you therefore agree that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief in case of any such breach or threatened breach. Any references in your Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement to the Prior Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to refer to this Agreement.

Except to the extent that an alternative reduction order would result in a greater economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis, the parties intend that the Total Payments shall be reduced in the following order: (w) reduction of any cash severance payments otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (x) reduction of any other cash payments or benefits otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (y) reduction of any other payments or benefits otherwise payable to you on a pro-rata basis or such other manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting and payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and (z) reduction of any payments attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code; provided, in case of clauses (x), (y) and (z), that reduction of any payments or benefits attributable to the acceleration of vesting of Company equity awards shall be first applied to equity awards with later vesting dates; provided, further, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such reduction shall be undertaken in a manner that complies with and does not result in the imposition of additional taxes on you under Section 409A of the Code. The foregoing reductions shall be made in a manner that results in the maximum economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis and, to the extent economically equivalent payments or benefits are subject to reduction, in a pro rata manner. oAll determinations regarding the application of the paragraph above shall be made by an independent accounting firm or consulting group with nationally recognized standing and substantial expertise and experience in performing calculations regarding the applicability of Section 280G of the Code and the Excise Tax retained by the Company prior to the date of the applicable change in ownership or control (the “280G Firm”). For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which (x) does not constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, or (y) constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the “base amount” 10 |US-DOCS\\\\138338525.3||16/04/2025, 06:44 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036018 10/17 (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such reasonable compensation, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which you shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a “payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account, and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the 280G Firm in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. All determinations related to the calculations to be performed pursuant to this “Best Pay Provision” section shall be done by the 280G Firm. The 280G Firm will be directed to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both you and the Company within fifteen (15) days after notification from either the Company or you that you may receive payments which may be “parachute payments.” You and the Company will each provide the 280G Firm access to and copies of any books, records, and documents as may be reasonably requested by the 280G Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the 280G Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the 280G Firm for its services in connection with the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement will be borne solely by the Company. •EMPLOYMENT T ERMS .

If a Change in Control would give rise to a payment or settlement event with respect to any payment or benefit that constitutes “nonqualified deferred compensation,” the transaction or event constituting the Change in Control must also constitute a “change in control event” (as defined in Treasury Regulation §1.409A-3(i)(5)) in order to give rise to the payment or settlement event for such payment or benefit, to the extent required by Section 409A. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Change in Control Period” means the 24 months following a Change in Control. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason” means any of the following without your written consent: (a) a material diminution in your authority, duties or responsibilities, including a requirement that you report to a corporate officer other than the Chief Executive Officer; (b) a material diminution in your base compensation (and you and the Company agree that any diminution of 10% or more shall be considered material for this purpose, regardless of whether such diminution occurs due to a single reduction or a series of reductions in your base compensation), unless such a reduction is imposed across-the-board to senior management of the Company; (c) a material change in the geographic location at which you must perform your duties (and you and the Company agree that a relocation of the geographic location at which you must perform your duties to a location that increases your one-way commute from your residence by more than 50 miles as compared to your principal place of employment prior to such relocation shall be considered material for this purpose); or (d) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company or any successor or affiliate of its obligations to you under this Agreement or the Stock Restriction Agreement. You must provide written notice to the Company of the occurrence of any of the foregoing events or conditions without your written consent within 6 months of the occurrence of such event. The Company or any successor or affiliate shall have a period of 30 days to cure such event or condition after receipt of written notice of such event from you. Your termination of employment by reason of resignation from employment with the Company for Good Reason must occur within 30 days following the expiration of the foregoing 30-day cure period. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Stock Awards” means all stock options, restricted stock and such other awards granted pursuant to the Company’s stock option and equity incentive award plans or agreements and any shares of stock issued upon exercise thereof (other than any shares (the “Founders’ Shares”) the vesting of which is governed by that certain Restricted Stock Grant Notice and Restricted Stock Agreement dated February 8, 2021, between you and the Company (the “Stock Restriction Agreement”)). For the avoidance of doubt, your 7 |US-DOCS\\\\138581474.1||16/04/2025, 06:44 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036017 7/15Qualifying Termination under this Agreement shall constitute a Qualifying Termination for purposes of the Stock Restriction Agreement. o To the extent applicable, this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder. The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with, or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance with such intention. To the extent that any provision in this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with or exemption from Section 409A of the Code, the provision shall be read in such a manner that no payments payable under this Agreement shall be subject to an “additional tax” as defined in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, any right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. For purposes of this Agreement, all references to your “termination of employment” shall mean your “separation from service” (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)) (“Separation from Service”). If you are a “specified employee” (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), as determined by the Company in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, on the date of your Separation from Service, to the extent that the payments or benefits under this Agreement are “non-qualified deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code and the delayed payment or distribution of all or any portion of such amounts to which you are entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then such portion deferred pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid or distributed to you in a lump sum on the earlier of (a) the date that is 6 months and one day following your Separation from Service, (b) the date of your death or (c) the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code. Any remaining payments due under this Agreement shall be paid as otherwise provided herein. o To the extent that the payments or benefits under this Agreement are “non- qualified deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code, if the period during which you may deliver the Release required hereunder spans two calendar years, the payment of your post- termination benefits shall occur (or commence) on the later of (a) January 1 of the second calendar year, or (b) the first regularly-scheduled payroll date following the date your Release becomes effective. o Any reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits payable under this Agreement shall be made in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv) and shall be paid on or before the last day of your taxable year following the taxable year in which you incurred the expenses. The amount of expenses reimbursed or in-kind benefits payable in one year shall not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits payable in any other taxable year of yours, and your right to reimbursement for such amounts shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. 8 |US-DOCS\\\\138581474.1||16/04/2025, 06:44 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036017 8/15•COMP ANY P OLICIES A ND P ROPRIET ARY I NFORMA TION AND I NVENTIONS A SSIGNMENT A GREEMENT . As an employee of the Company, you shall be expected to abide by all of the Company’s policies and procedures and the Company’s employee handbook, if any. You and the Company have entered into a Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement, attached hereto as Exhibit A, which shall survive termination of your employment with the Company and the termination of the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement. You reaffirm your obligations under the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement and acknowledge that a remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement would be inadequate, and you therefore agree that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief in case of any such breach or threatened breach. Any references in your Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement to the Prior Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to refer to this Agreement. The Company may modify, revoke, suspend or terminate any of the terms, plans, policies and/or procedures described in the employee handbook, if any, or as otherwise communicated to you, in whole or part, at any time, with or without notice. •BEST P AY P ROVISION . oIn the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by you pursuant to the terms of any plan, arrangement or agreement (including any payment or benefit received in connection with a change in ownership or control or the termination of your employment) (all such payments and benefits being hereinafter referred to as the “Total Payments”) would be subject (in whole or part) to the excise tax (the “Excise Tax”) imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, then the Total Payments shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax but only if (i) the net amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced (after subtracting the amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (ii) the net amount of such Total Payments without such reduction (after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax to which you would be subject in respect of such unreduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such unreduced Total Payments). Except to the extent that an alternative reduction order would result in a greater economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis, the parties intend that the Total Payments shall be reduced in the following order: (w) reduction of any cash severance payments otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (x) reduction of any other cash payments or benefits otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (y) reduction of any other payments or benefits otherwise payable to you on a pro-rata basis or such other manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting and payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and (z) reduction of any payments attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code; provided, in case of clauses (x), (y) and (z), that reduction of any payments or benefits attributable to the acceleration of vesting of Company equity awards shall be first applied to equity awards with later vesting dates; provided, further, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such 9 |US-DOCS\\\\138581474.1||16/04/2025, 06:44 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036017 9/15reduction shall be undertaken in a manner that complies with and does not result in the imposition of additional taxes on you under Section 409A of the Code. The foregoing reductions shall be made in a manner that results in the maximum economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis and, to the extent economically equivalent payments or benefits are subject to reduction, in a pro rata manner. oAll determinations regarding the application of the paragraph above shall be made by an independent accounting firm or consulting group with nationally recognized standing and substantial expertise and experience in performing calculations regarding the applicability of Section 280G of the Code and the Excise Tax retained by the Company prior to the date of the applicable change in ownership or control (the “280G Firm”). For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which (x) does not constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, or (y) constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the “base amount” (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such reasonable compensation, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which you shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a “payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account, and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the 280G Firm in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. All determinations related to the calculations to be performed pursuant to this “Best Pay Provision” section shall be done by the 280G Firm. The 280G Firm will be directed to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both you and the Company within fifteen (15) days after notification from either the Company or you that you may receive payments which may be “parachute payments.” You and the Company will each provide the 280G Firm access to and copies of any books, records, and documents as may be reasonably requested by the 280G Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the 280G Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the 280G Firm for its services in connection with the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement will be borne solely by the Company. •EMPLOYMENT T ERMS .

You represent and agree that your performance of your duties for the Company shall not violate any agreements, obligations or understandings that you may have with any third party or prior employer. Without limiting the foregoing, you represent and agree that you are not bound by any non-compete or non-solicitation agreement or any other type of agreement that would prohibit your employment with the Company. You agree not to make any unauthorized disclosure or use, on behalf of the Company, of any confidential information belonging to any of your former employers. You also represent that you are not in unauthorized possession of any materials containing a third party’s confidential and proprietary information. While employed by the Company, you will not engage in any business activity 10 |US-DOCS\\\\138581474.1||16/04/2025, 06:44 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036017 10/15in competition with the Company nor make preparations to do so. In the event that you wish to undertake a business activity outside the scope of your employment by the Company, which activity you believe entails no conflict with the Company’s activities, you agree to inform the Company of your intentions before the initiation of such outside business activity, and you furthermore agree to abide by the Company’s decision as to whether or not there is no conflict. If, in the Company’s sole determination, a conflict exists or is likely to develop, you agree not to undertake such outside business activity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company expressly acknowledges and agrees to your continued services to Frazier Healthcare Partners, Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its other portfolio companies and further acknowledges and agrees that such continued services will not violate the terms of this Agreement. •AT- WILL E MPLOYMENT .

This is the full and complete agreement between you and the Company on this term. Although your job duties, title, compensation and benefits, as well as the Company’s personnel policies and procedures, may change from time to time, the “at will” nature of your employment may only be changed in an express written agreement signed by you and a duly authorized officer of the Company. •NON-I NTERFERENCE . While employed by the Company, and for one (1) year immediately following the date on which you terminate employment or otherwise cease providing services to the Company, you agree not to interfere with the business of the Company by (a) soliciting or attempting to solicit any employee or consultant of the Company to terminate such employee’s or consultant’s employment or service in order to become an employee, consultant or independent contractor to or for any other person or entity or (b) soliciting or attempting to solicit any vendor, supplier, customer or other person or entity either directly or indirectly, to direct his, her or its purchase of the Company’s products and/or services to any person, firm, corporation, institution or other entity in competition with the business of the Company. The foregoing restrictions shall not apply with respect to the bona fide hiring and firing of Company personnel to the extent such acts are part of your duties for Company. Your duties under this paragraph shall survive termination of your employment with the Company and the termination of this Agreement. •REASONABLENESS OF T ERMS . You agree that the terms contained in the “Other Agreements” and “Non- Interference” paragraphs above are reasonable in all respects and that the restrictions contained therein are designed to protect the Company against unfair competition. In the event a court determines that any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement are unreasonable, the court may limit the application of any provision or term, or modify any provision or term, and proceed to enforce this Agreement as so limited or modified. •GOVERNING L AW ; J URISDICTION AND V ENU E .

In the event the Release does not become effective within the 60-day period following the date of your termination of employment, you will not be entitled to the aforesaid payments and benefits. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” means any of the following: (a) your commission of an act of fraud, embezzlement or dishonesty, or the commission of some other illegal act by you, that has a demonstrable adverse impact on the Company or any successor or affiliate thereof; (b) your conviction of, or plea of “guilty” or “no contest” to, a non-vehicular felony or any crime involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude under the laws of the United States or any state 5 |US-DOCS\\\\138581468.1||16/04/2025, 06:45 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036016 5/15 thereof; (c) any intentional, unauthorized use or disclosure by you of confidential information or trade secrets of the Company or any successor or affiliate thereof; (d) your gross negligence, insubordination or material violation of any duty of loyalty to the Company or any successor or affiliate thereof, or any other demonstrable material misconduct on your part; (e) your ongoing and repeated failure or refusal to perform or neglect of your duties as required by this Agreement or your ongoing and repeated failure or refusal to comply with the reasonable and lawful instructions given to you by the Board, which failure, refusal or neglect continues for 15 days following your receipt of written notice from the Board stating with specificity the nature of such failure, refusal or neglect; provided that it is understood that this clause (e) shall not permit the Company to terminate your employment for Cause solely because of (i) your failure to meet specified performance objectives or achieve a specific result or outcome, or (ii) Company’s dissatisfaction with the quality of services provided by you in the good faith performance of your duties to the Company; or (f) your willful, material breach of any material Company policy or any material provision of this Agreement or the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement. Prior to the determination that “Cause” under clauses (d), (e) or (f) has occurred, the Company shall (i) provide to you in writing, in reasonable detail, the reasons for the determination that such “Cause” exists, (ii) other than with respect to clause (e) above which specifies the applicable period of time for you to remedy your breach, afford you a reasonable opportunity to remedy any such breach, (iii) provide you an opportunity to be heard prior to the final decision to terminate your employment hereunder for such “Cause” and (iv) make any decision that such “Cause” exists in good faith. The foregoing definition shall not in any way preclude or restrict the right of the Company or any successor or affiliate thereof to discharge or dismiss you for any other acts or omissions, but such other acts or omissions shall not be deemed, for purposes of this Agreement, to constitute grounds for termination for Cause. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Change in Control” shall mean (a) a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any other corporation or other entity or person, (b) a sale, lease, exchange or other transfer in one transaction or a series of related transactions of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, or (c) any other transaction, including the sale by the Company of new shares of its capital stock or a transfer of existing shares of capital stock of the Company, the result of which is that a third party that is not an affiliate of the Company or its stockholders (or a group of third parties not affiliated with the Company or its stockholders) immediately prior to such transaction acquires or holds capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the Company’s outstanding voting power immediately following such transaction; provided that the following events shall not constitute a “Change in Control”: (i) a transaction (other than a sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets) in which the holders of the voting securities of the Company immediately prior to the merger or consolidation hold, directly or indirectly, at least a majority of the voting securities in the successor corporation or its parent immediately after the merger or consolidation; (ii) a sale, lease, exchange or other transaction in one transaction or a series of related transactions of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to an affiliate of the Company; (iii) an initial public offering of any of the Company’s securities or any 6 |US-DOCS\\\\138581468.1||16/04/2025, 06:45 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036016 6/15 other transaction or series of related transactions principally for bona fide equity financing purposes; (iv) a reincorporation of the Company solely to change its jurisdiction; or (v) a transaction undertaken for the primary purpose of creating a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same proportion by the persons who held the Company’s securities immediately before such transaction. If a Change in Control would give rise to a payment or settlement event with respect to any payment or benefit that constitutes “nonqualified deferred compensation,” the transaction or event constituting the Change in Control must also constitute a “change in control event” (as defined in Treasury Regulation §1.409A-3(i)(5)) in order to give rise to the payment or settlement event for such payment or benefit, to the extent required by Section 409A. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Change in Control Period” means the 24 months following a Change in Control. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason” means any of the following without your written consent: (a) a material diminution in your authority, duties or responsibilities, including a requirement that you report to a corporate officer in lieu of the Board; (b) a material diminution in your base compensation (and you and the Company agree that any diminution of 10% or more shall be considered material for this purpose, regardless of whether such diminution occurs due to a single reduction or a series of reductions in your base compensation), unless such a reduction is imposed across-the-board to senior management of the Company; (c) a material change in the geographic location at which you must perform your duties (and you and the Company agree that a relocation of the geographic location at which you must perform your duties to a location that increases your one-way commute from your residence by more than 50 miles as compared to your principal place of employment prior to such relocation shall be considered material for this purpose); or (d) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company or any successor or affiliate of its obligations to you under this Agreement or the Stock Restriction Agreement. You must provide written notice to the Company of the occurrence of any of the foregoing events or conditions without your written consent within 6 months of the occurrence of such event. The Company or any successor or affiliate shall have a period of 30 days to cure such event or condition after receipt of written notice of such event from you. Your termination of employment by reason of resignation from employment with the Company for Good Reason must occur within 30 days following the expiration of the foregoing 30-day cure period. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Stock Awards” means all stock options, restricted stock and such other awards granted pursuant to the Company’s stock option and equity incentive award plans or agreements and any shares of stock issued upon exercise thereof (other than any shares (the “Founders’ Shares”) the vesting of which is governed by that certain Stock Restriction Agreement dated February 8, 2021, between you and the Company (the “Stock Restriction Agreement”)). For the avoidance of doubt, your Qualifying Termination under this Agreement shall constitute a Qualifying Termination for purposes of the Stock Restriction Agreement. 7 |US-DOCS\\\\138581468.1||16/04/2025, 06:45 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036016 7/15 o To the extent applicable, this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder. The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with, or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance with such intention. To the extent that any provision in this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with or exemption from Section 409A of the Code, the provision shall be read in such a manner that no payments payable under this Agreement shall be subject to an “additional tax” as defined in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, any right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. For purposes of this Agreement, all references to your “termination of employment” shall mean your “separation from service” (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)) (“Separation from Service”). If you are a “specified employee” (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), as determined by the Company in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, on the date of your Separation from Service, to the extent that the payments or benefits under this Agreement are “non-qualified deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code and the delayed payment or distribution of all or any portion of such amounts to which you are entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then such portion deferred pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid or distributed to you in a lump sum on the earlier of (a) the date that is 6 months and one day following your Separation from Service, (b) the date of your death or (c) the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code. Any remaining payments due under this Agreement shall be paid as otherwise provided herein. o To the extent that the payments or benefits under this Agreement are “non- qualified deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code, if the period during which you may deliver the Release required hereunder spans two calendar years, the payment of your post- termination benefits shall occur (or commence) on the later of (a) January 1 of the second calendar year, or (b) the first regularly-scheduled payroll date following the date your Release becomes effective. o Any reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits payable under this Agreement shall be made in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv) and shall be paid on or before the last day of your taxable year following the taxable year in which you incurred the expenses. The amount of expenses reimbursed or in-kind benefits payable in one year shall not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits payable in any other taxable year of yours, and your right to reimbursement for such amounts shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. •COMP ANY P OLICIES A ND P ROPRIET ARY I NFORMA TION AND I NVENTIONS A SSIGNMENT A GREEMENT .

You reaffirm your obligations under the Proprietary Information and Investigations Assignment Agreement and acknowledge that a remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement would be inadequate, and you therefore agree that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief in case of any such breach or threatened breach. Any references in your Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement to the Prior Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to refer to this Agreement. The Company may modify, revoke, suspend or terminate any of the terms, plans, policies and/or procedures described in the employee handbook, if any, or as otherwise communicated to you, in whole or part, at any time, with or without notice. •BEST P AY P ROVISION . oIn the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by you pursuant to the terms of any plan, arrangement or agreement (including any payment or benefit received in connection with a change in ownership or control or the termination of your employment) (all such payments and benefits being hereinafter referred to as the “Total Payments”) would be subject (in whole or part) to the excise tax (the “Excise Tax”) imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, then the Total Payments shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax but only if (i) the net amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced (after subtracting the amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (ii) the net amount of such Total Payments without such reduction (after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax to which you would be subject in respect of such unreduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such unreduced Total Payments). Except to the extent that an alternative reduction order would result in a greater economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis, the parties intend that the Total Payments shall be reduced in the following order: (w) reduction of any cash severance payments otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (x) reduction of any other cash payments or benefits otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (y) reduction of any other payments or benefits otherwise payable to you on a pro-rata basis or such other manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting and payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and (z) reduction of any payments attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code; provided, in case of clauses (x), (y) and (z), that reduction of any payments or benefits attributable to the acceleration of vesting of Company equity awards shall be first applied to equity awards with later vesting dates; provided, further, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such reduction shall be undertaken in a manner that complies with and does not result in the imposition of additional taxes on you under Section 409A of the Code. The foregoing reductions shall be made in a manner that results in the maximum economic benefit to you 9 |US-DOCS\\\\138581468.1||16/04/2025, 06:45 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036016 9/15 on an after-tax basis and, to the extent economically equivalent payments or benefits are subject to reduction, in a pro rata manner. oAll determinations regarding the application of the paragraph above shall be made by an independent accounting firm or consulting group with nationally recognized standing and substantial expertise and experience in performing calculations regarding the applicability of Section 280G of the Code and the Excise Tax retained by the Company prior to the date of the applicable change in ownership or control (the “280G Firm”). For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which (x) does not constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, or (y) constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the “base amount” (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such reasonable compensation, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which you shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a “payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account, and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the 280G Firm in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. All determinations related to the calculations to be performed pursuant to this “Best Pay Provision” section shall be done by the 280G Firm. The 280G Firm will be directed to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both you and the Company within fifteen (15) days after notification from either the Company or you that you may receive payments which may be “parachute payments.” You and the Company will each provide the 280G Firm access to and copies of any books, records, and documents as may be reasonably requested by the 280G Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the 280G Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the 280G Firm for its services in connection with the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement will be borne solely by the Company. •EMPLOYMENT T ERMS .

While employed by the Company, you will not engage in any business activity in competition with the Company nor make preparations to do so. In the event that you wish to undertake a business activity outside the scope of your employment by the Company, which activity you believe entails no conflict with the Company’s activities, you agree to inform the Company of your intentions 10 |US-DOCS\\\\138581468.1||16/04/2025, 06:45 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036016 10/15 before the initiation of such outside business activity, and you furthermore agree to abide by the Company’s decision as to whether or not there is no conflict.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company expressly acknowledges and agrees to your continued services to Frazier Healthcare Partners and its other portfolio companies, and NSTG, Cajal Neuroscience, Adaptive Biotechnologies, Fate Therapeutics, Silverback Therapeutics, GuideTX, Nanostring Technologies, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Danaher Corporation, Dragonfly Therapeutics, and Variant Bio, and further acknowledges and agrees that such continued services will not violate the terms of this Agreement. •AT- WILL E MPLOYMENT .

This is the full and complete agreement between you and the Company on this term.

The foregoing restrictions shall not apply with respect to the bona fide hiring and firing of Company personnel to the extent such acts are part of your duties for Company. Your duties under this paragraph shall survive termination of your employment with the Company and the termination of this Agreement. •REASONABLENESS OF T ERMS .

Prior to the determination that “Cause” under clauses (d), (e) or (f) has occurred, the Company shall (i) provide to you in writing, in reasonable detail, the reasons for the determination that such “Cause” exists, (ii) other than with respect to clause (e) above which specifies the applicable period of time for you to remedy your breach, afford you a reasonable opportunity to remedy any such breach, (iii) provide you an opportunity to be heard prior to the final decision to terminate your employment hereunder for such “Cause” and (iv) make any decision that such “Cause” exists in good faith. The foregoing definition shall not in any way preclude or restrict the right of the Company or any successor or affiliate thereof to discharge or dismiss you for any other acts or omissions, but such other acts or omissions shall not be deemed, for purposes of this Agreement, to constitute grounds for termination for Cause. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Change in Control” shall mean (a) a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any other corporation or other entity or person, (b) a sale, lease, exchange or other transfer in one transaction or a series of related transactions of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, or (c) any other transaction, including the sale by the Company of new shares of its capital stock or a transfer of existing shares of capital stock of the Company, the result of which is that a third party that is not an affiliate of the Company or its stockholders (or a group of third parties not affiliated with the Company or its stockholders) immediately prior to such transaction acquires or holds capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the Company’s outstanding voting power immediately following such transaction; provided that the following events shall not constitute a “Change in Control”: (i) a transaction (other than a sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets) in which the holders of the voting securities of the Company immediately prior to the merger or consolidation hold, directly or indirectly, at least a majority of the voting securities in the successor corporation or its parent immediately after the merger or consolidation; (ii) a sale, lease, exchange or other transaction in one transaction or a series of related transactions of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to an affiliate of the Company; (iii) an initial public offering of any of the Company’s securities or any 6 |US-DOCS\\\\138581468.1||16/04/2025, 06:45 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036016 6/15 other transaction or series of related transactions principally for bona fide equity financing purposes; (iv) a reincorporation of the Company solely to change its jurisdiction; or (v) a transaction undertaken for the primary purpose of creating a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same proportion by the persons who held the Company’s securities immediately before such transaction. If a Change in Control would give rise to a payment or settlement event with respect to any payment or benefit that constitutes “nonqualified deferred compensation,” the transaction or event constituting the Change in Control must also constitute a “change in control event” (as defined in Treasury Regulation §1.409A-3(i)(5)) in order to give rise to the payment or settlement event for such payment or benefit, to the extent required by Section 409A. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Change in Control Period” means the 24 months following a Change in Control. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason” means any of the following without your written consent: (a) a material diminution in your authority, duties or responsibilities, including a requirement that you report to a corporate officer in lieu of the Board; (b) a material diminution in your base compensation (and you and the Company agree that any diminution of 10% or more shall be considered material for this purpose, regardless of whether such diminution occurs due to a single reduction or a series of reductions in your base compensation), unless such a reduction is imposed across-the-board to senior management of the Company; (c) a material change in the geographic location at which you must perform your duties (and you and the Company agree that a relocation of the geographic location at which you must perform your duties to a location that increases your one-way commute from your residence by more than 50 miles as compared to your principal place of employment prior to such relocation shall be considered material for this purpose); or (d) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company or any successor or affiliate of its obligations to you under this Agreement or the Stock Restriction Agreement. You must provide written notice to the Company of the occurrence of any of the foregoing events or conditions without your written consent within 6 months of the occurrence of such event. The Company or any successor or affiliate shall have a period of 30 days to cure such event or condition after receipt of written notice of such event from you. Your termination of employment by reason of resignation from employment with the Company for Good Reason must occur within 30 days following the expiration of the foregoing 30-day cure period. o For purposes of this Agreement, “Stock Awards” means all stock options, restricted stock and such other awards granted pursuant to the Company’s stock option and equity incentive award plans or agreements and any shares of stock issued upon exercise thereof (other than any shares (the “Founders’ Shares”) the vesting of which is governed by that certain Stock Restriction Agreement dated February 8, 2021, between you and the Company (the “Stock Restriction Agreement”)). For the avoidance of doubt, your Qualifying Termination under this Agreement shall constitute a Qualifying Termination for purposes of the Stock Restriction Agreement. 7 |US-DOCS\\\\138581468.1||16/04/2025, 06:45 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036016 7/15 o To the extent applicable, this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder. The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with, or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance with such intention. To the extent that any provision in this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with or exemption from Section 409A of the Code, the provision shall be read in such a manner that no payments payable under this Agreement shall be subject to an “additional tax” as defined in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, any right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. For purposes of this Agreement, all references to your “termination of employment” shall mean your “separation from service” (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)) (“Separation from Service”). If you are a “specified employee” (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), as determined by the Company in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, on the date of your Separation from Service, to the extent that the payments or benefits under this Agreement are “non-qualified deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code and the delayed payment or distribution of all or any portion of such amounts to which you are entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then such portion deferred pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid or distributed to you in a lump sum on the earlier of (a) the date that is 6 months and one day following your Separation from Service, (b) the date of your death or (c) the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code. Any remaining payments due under this Agreement shall be paid as otherwise provided herein. o To the extent that the payments or benefits under this Agreement are “non- qualified deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code, if the period during which you may deliver the Release required hereunder spans two calendar years, the payment of your post- termination benefits shall occur (or commence) on the later of (a) January 1 of the second calendar year, or (b) the first regularly-scheduled payroll date following the date your Release becomes effective. o Any reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits payable under this Agreement shall be made in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv) and shall be paid on or before the last day of your taxable year following the taxable year in which you incurred the expenses. The amount of expenses reimbursed or in-kind benefits payable in one year shall not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits payable in any other taxable year of yours, and your right to reimbursement for such amounts shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. •COMP ANY P OLICIES A ND P ROPRIET ARY I NFORMA TION AND I NVENTIONS A SSIGNMENT A GREEMENT .

You reaffirm your obligations under the Proprietary Information and Investigations Assignment Agreement and acknowledge that a remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of the Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement would be inadequate, and you therefore agree that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief in case of any such breach or threatened breach. Any references in your Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement to the Prior Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to refer to this Agreement. The Company may modify, revoke, suspend or terminate any of the terms, plans, policies and/or procedures described in the employee handbook, if any, or as otherwise communicated to you, in whole or part, at any time, with or without notice. •BEST P AY P ROVISION . oIn the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by you pursuant to the terms of any plan, arrangement or agreement (including any payment or benefit received in connection with a change in ownership or control or the termination of your employment) (all such payments and benefits being hereinafter referred to as the “Total Payments”) would be subject (in whole or part) to the excise tax (the “Excise Tax”) imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, then the Total Payments shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax but only if (i) the net amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced (after subtracting the amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (ii) the net amount of such Total Payments without such reduction (after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax to which you would be subject in respect of such unreduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such unreduced Total Payments). Except to the extent that an alternative reduction order would result in a greater economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis, the parties intend that the Total Payments shall be reduced in the following order: (w) reduction of any cash severance payments otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (x) reduction of any other cash payments or benefits otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (y) reduction of any other payments or benefits otherwise payable to you on a pro-rata basis or such other manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting and payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and (z) reduction of any payments attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code; provided, in case of clauses (x), (y) and (z), that reduction of any payments or benefits attributable to the acceleration of vesting of Company equity awards shall be first applied to equity awards with later vesting dates; provided, further, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such reduction shall be undertaken in a manner that complies with and does not result in the imposition of additional taxes on you under Section 409A of the Code. The foregoing reductions shall be made in a manner that results in the maximum economic benefit to you 9 |US-DOCS\\\\138581468.1||16/04/2025, 06:45 EX-10 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036016 9/15 on an after-tax basis and, to the extent economically equivalent payments or benefits are subject to reduction, in a pro rata manner. oAll determinations regarding the application of the paragraph above shall be made by an independent accounting firm or consulting group with nationally recognized standing and substantial expertise and experience in performing calculations regarding the applicability of Section 280G of the Code and the Excise Tax retained by the Company prior to the date of the applicable change in ownership or control (the “280G Firm”). For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which (x) does not constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, or (y) constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the “base amount” (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such reasonable compensation, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which you shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a “payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account, and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the 280G Firm in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. All determinations related to the calculations to be performed pursuant to this “Best Pay Provision” section shall be done by the 280G Firm. The 280G Firm will be directed to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both you and the Company within fifteen (15) days after notification from either the Company or you that you may receive payments which may be “parachute payments.” You and the Company will each provide the 280G Firm access to and copies of any books, records, and documents as may be reasonably requested by the 280G Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the 280G Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement.

The COBRA Payment shall be paid (i) on the First Payment Date and (ii) regardless of whether the Executive elects COBRA continuation coverage under the Company’ s group health plan; (d) The Company shall pay the Executive any incentive compensation under the IC Plan as follows: (i) the incentive compensation that the Executive would have received for the season which includes the Executive’ s Termination Date if the Executive had remained employed with the Company through the completion of such season, pro-rated to such Termination Date and based on actual performance; and (ii) the incentive compensation under the IC Plan that the Executive would have received if the Executive had remained employe d with the Company for a period of two (2) years (i.e., the next four (4) seasons under the IC Plan) after the Termination Date based on actual performance, less applicable withholding, subject to the terms of the IC Plan. The foregoing payments shall be paid at the same time as payments under the IC Plan are typically paid, but in no event later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the applicable season is completed; andt h Exhibit I-216/04/2025, 06:54 Document https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036958 8/3016/04/2025, 06:54 Document https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036958 9/30(e) The treatment of any outstanding equity awards shall be determined as follows: (i) A pro-rata portion of the outstanding unvested equity awards that are held by the Executive as of the Termination Date and vest only based on the passage of time shall vest and be settled on the First Payment Date, which pro-rata vesting shall be determined by (A) multiplying (x) the number of shares subject to the award by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of complete months between the ﬁrst day of the applicable time-based vesting period and the Termination Date, and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of months in the time-based vesting period, less (B) the number of shares subject to the award that had already vested pursuant to the award’ s terms prior to the Termination Date, if any; (ii) A pro-rata portion of the outstan ding unvested equity awards that are held by the Executive as of the Termination Date and vest based, at least in part, on the satisfaction of performance goals shall vest and be settled promptly following the end of the performance period, but in any event not earlier than the First Payment Date or later than the end of the calendar year in which the performance period ends, which pro-rata vesting shall be determined by (A) multiplying the number of shares that the Executive would have earned for the entire performance period based on the level of performance determined in accordance with the applicable plan and award agreements by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of complete months between the ﬁrst day of the applicable performance period and the Termination Date, and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of months in the performance period (or vesting period, if longer); (iii) To the extent that any outstanding unvested equity award that is held by the Executive as of the Termination Date would vest at a greater percentage under the terms of the applicable plan and award agreement than as provided for under Sections 4(e)(i)-(ii), the terms of such award agreement shall instead determine the number of shares covered by such equity award that will vest under this Section 4(e), subject to Sections 4(e)(iv)-(v); (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no equity awards that are outstanding as of the Termination Date will be forfeited during the three (3)-month period commencing upon the Termination Date, provided, that, (x) to the extent a Change in Control occurs during such three (3)- month period, any such equity awards that are outstanding and unve sted as of the Change in Control will instead be treated in accordance with Section 5; and (y) to the extent a Change in Control does not occur during such three (3)-month period, any portion of the equity awards outstanding as of Termination Date that do not vest pursuant to Sections 4(e)(i)-(iii) shall be forfeited; and (v) To the extent that the payment or settlement of any equity awards in accordance with the foregoing would constitute an impermissible change in the time or form of payment under Section 409A of the Code, then such portion shall be payable at a time that would be permitted under Section 409A of the Code and that is as near as possible to the payment timing contemplated by the foregoing. 5. Severance Upon a Qualifying Termination Within the Protection Period . If the Executive has a Qualifying Termination within the Protection Period, then, subject to Section 6, the Company will provide the Executive with the following (collectively , the “Change in Control Severance Beneﬁts ”): (a) The payments and beneﬁts described in Sections 4(a), (b), and (c); provided, however , that if the Termination Date occurs during the portion of the Protection Period that occurs on or following a Change in Control, and such Change in Control is a Change in Control Event, then the total of the salary continuation amounts described in Section 4(b) will Exhibit I-316/04/2025, 06:54 Document https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036958 10/3016/04/2025, 06:54 Document https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036958 11/30instead be paid to the Executive in a single lump sum, less applicable withholding, on the First Payment Date; (b) A payment equal to the sum of the incentive compensation payouts that the Executive actually received under the IC Plan for the four (4) completed seasons immediately preceding the Termination Date, with the amount of any payout that is prorated with respect to any seasonal incentive period in which the Executive was not employed by the Company for the entirety of such incentive period to be annualized (the “Bonus Amount ”); provided, however , that if, as of the Executive’ s Termination Date, the Executive has not been employed for a long enough period to have been eligible for four (4) seasons of incentive compensa tion payouts under the IC Plan, the seasonal target incentive award opportunity applicable to the Executive as of immediately prior to the Termination Date shall be used for purposes of calculating the Bonus Amount for any season during which the Executive was not eligible for a payout under IC Plan solely as a result of the Executive’ s date of commencement of employment. The Bonus Amount shall be paid, less applicable withholding, in a lump sum cash payment on the First Payment Date; (c) A payment equal to the produc t of (i) the average of the incentive compensation payouts that the Executive actually received under the IC Plan for the four (4) completed seasons immediately preceding the Executiv e’s Termination Date, with the amount of any payout that is prorated with respect to any seasonal incentive period in which the Executive was not employed by the Company for the entirety of such incentive period to be annualized and, if, as of the Executive’ s Termination Date, the Executive has not been employed for a long enough period to have been eligible for four (4) seasons of incentive compensation payouts under the IC Plan, then for purposes of such average, the seasonal target incentive award opportunity applicable to the Executive as of immediately prior to the Termination Date shall be used for any season in which the Executive was not eligible for a payout under IC Plan solely as a result of the Executive’ s date of commencement of employment, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the season (within the meaning of the IC Plan) in which the Termination Date occurs that elapsed through the Termination Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such season. The foregoing payment, less applicable withholding, shall be paid on the First Payment Date; (d) If any action at law, in equity , or arbitration, including an action for declaratory relief, is brought by the Executive to obtain or enforce any rights provided by this Section 5, the Company shall pay or reimburse the Executive for all documented legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the Executive in such action. Such amounts shall be paid or reimbursed on a monthly basis for expenses incurred in the preceding month; provided that the Executive will be required to promptly repay to the Company any amounts paid or reimbursed under this paragraph to the extent an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Executive’ s position in such action is frivolous or in bad faith; and (e) All of the outstanding and unvested equity awards held by the Executive immediately before such Qualifying Termination will immediately become fully vested and payable on the First Payment Date, provided that, to the extent that paying any portion of such amount in accordance with the foregoing would constitute an impermissible change in the time or form of payment under Section 409A of the Code, then such portion shall be payable at a time that would be permitted under Section 409A of the Code and that is as near as possible to the payment timing contemplated by the foregoing. To the extent that an equity award vests based on the achievement of performance goals, performance goals will be deemed to be achieved at target levels if less than one-third of the applicable performance period has elapsed as of the date of the Change in Control, otherwise performance goals will be deemed to be achieved at maximum levels. Exhibit I-416/04/2025, 06:54 Document https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036958 12/30(f) In the event that the Termination Date occurs during the portion of the Protection Period that precedes a Change in Control and the Executive has already commenced receiving payments and/or beneﬁts under Section 4 prior to the Change in Control, then the Executive will be entitled to the payments and beneﬁts under this Section 5 in lieu of any additional payments or beneﬁts under Section 4, but only to the extent an equivalent payment and/or beneﬁt has not already been paid or provided pursuant to Section 4. 6. Release Requirement . Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary , the Company shall not make or provide the Severance Beneﬁts or the Change in Control Severance Beneﬁts (in each case, other than the Accrued Amounts) or waive its rights under Section 7(e) unless the Executive timely executes and delivers to the Company a release of claims in favor of the Company , its afﬁliates and their respective ofﬁcers and directors in a form provided by the Company (the “Release ”) and such Release becomes effective and irrevocable within sixty (60) days following the Executive’ s Termination Date. If the foregoing requirements are not satisﬁed by the Executive, then no Severance Beneﬁts nor Change in Control Severance Beneﬁts (in each case, other than the Accrued Amounts) shall be due to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement. 7. Effect on Other Plans, Agreements and Beneﬁts . (a) Any severance beneﬁts payable to the Executive under this Agreement will be in lieu of and not in addition to: (i) any severance beneﬁts to which the Executive would otherwise be entitled under any general severance policy or severance plan maintained by the Company or any agreement between the Executive and the Company that provides for severance beneﬁts (for the avoidance, other than any special written retention agreements); and (ii) any salary continuation provided for under the Conﬁdentiality , Noncompetition and Intellectual Property Agreement. (b) Any severance beneﬁts payable to the Executive under this Agree ment will not be counted as compensation for purposes of determining beneﬁts under any other beneﬁt policies or plans of the Company , except to the extent expressly provided therein. (c) The Executive’ s entitlement to any other beneﬁts not expressly referenced herein shall be determined in accordance with the applicable employee beneﬁt plans then in ef fect. (d) The Executive expressly agrees that any amounts the Executive may owe to the Company as of the Termination Date may be deducted from the amount s that the Company would otherwise owe to the Executive under this Agreement, subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. (e) Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other agreement to the contrary , if the Executive incurs a Termination for Cause, then all Variable Compensation shall be immediately canceled for no consideration. (f) The Executive will be subject to the Company’ s clawback policies in effect from time to time, if such policies are also applicable to all other executive ofﬁcers of the Company on the same terms. 8. Section 280G of the Code . (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary , if the Executive is a “disqualiﬁed individual” (as deﬁned in Section 280G(c) of the Code) and the payments and beneﬁts provided for in this Agreement, together with any other payments and beneﬁts which the Exhibit I-516/04/2025, 06:54 Document https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036958 13/30Executive has the right to receive from the Company or any other person, would constitute a “parachute payment” (as deﬁned in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code), then the payments and beneﬁts provided for in this Agreement will be either (a) reduced (but not below zero) so that the present value of such total amount s and beneﬁts received by the Executive from the Company and/or such person(s) will be $1.00 less than three (3) times the Executive’ s “base amount” (as deﬁned in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) and so that no portion of such amounts and beneﬁts received by the Executive will be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or (b) paid in full, whichever produces the better “net after-tax” economic position to the Executive (taking into account any applicable excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code and any other applicable taxes). (b) The reduction of payments and beneﬁts hereunder , if applicable, will be made by determining the Parachute Payment Ratio (as deﬁned below) for each payment or beneﬁt then reducing the total payments and beneﬁts in order , beginning with the payment or beneﬁt with the highest Parachute Payment Ratio. Payments or beneﬁts with the same Parachute Payment Ratio will be reduced based on the time of payment, with the latest payments or beneﬁts reduced ﬁrst. Payments or beneﬁts with the same Parachute Payment Ratio and the same time of payment will be reduced proportionately . For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Parachute Payment Ratio ” shall mean a fraction, (a) the numerator of which is the value of the applicable payment or beneﬁt, as calculated for purposes of Sectio n 280G of the Code, and (b) the denominator of which is the intrinsic (i.e., economic) value of such payment or beneﬁt. (c) The determination as to whether any such reduction in the amount of the payments and beneﬁts provided hereunder is necessary will be made applying principles, assumptions and procedures consistent with Section 280G of the Code by an accounting ﬁrm or law ﬁrm of national reputation that is selected for this purpose by the Com pany in its sole discretion (the “280G Firm”). In order to assess whether payments under this Agreement or otherwise qualify as reasonable compensation that is exempt from being a parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code, the 280G Firm or the Company may retain the services of an independent valuation expert. (d) If a reduced payment or beneﬁt is made or provided in accordance with this Section 8 and through error or otherwise that payment or beneﬁt, when aggregated with other payments and beneﬁts from the Company used in determining if a “parachute payment” exists, exceeds $1.00 less than three (3) times the Executive’ s base amount , then the Executive must immediately repay such excess to the Company upon notiﬁcation that an overpayment has been made. Nothing in this Section 8 will require the Company to be responsible for, or have any liability or obligation with respect to, the Executive’ s excise tax liabilities under Section 4999 of the Code. 9. Arbitration and Class and Representative Action W aiver . (a) The Parties agree that, subject to Section 9(b), any controversy or claim between the Company and the Executive arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its termination shall be settled and determined by a single arbitrator whose award shall be accepted as ﬁnal and binding upon the Parties. If the Executive initiates arbitration, the Executive will be responsible for paying one-half of the ﬁling fee. Each Party will be responsible for their own attorney’ s fees, subject to Section 5(d). The Parties shall jointly select an arbitrator from JAMS, Inc. (“JAMS ”) or the American Arbitration Associ ation (“AAA”) with at least ten (10) years of experience in employment disputes.

Unless the arbitrator determines additional discovery is necessary to adequately arbitrate Executive’ s claims, discovery shall be conducted in accordance with the then- current version of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Those rules can be found at https://www .law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp. The arbitration shall take place in Columbus, Ohio. Notwithstanding the AAA or JAMS rules, all parties to the arbitration shall have the right to ﬁle a dispositive motion and shall not be required to seek permission from the arbitrator to do so. Any decision or award as a result of any such arbitration proceeding shall be in writing and shall provide an explanation for all conclusions of law and fact and shall include the assessment of costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

(c) This Agreement also does not prevent the Executive from ﬁling a claim or charge with a federal, state or local administrative agency , such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, or similar state or local agencies. (d) This Agreement does not prohibit those limited circumstances under which either Party ﬁnds it necessary to seek emergency or temporary injunctive relief, such as a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order , from a court that may be necessary to protect any rights or property of either Party pending the establishment of the arbitral tribunal or its determination of the merits of the dispute. (e) CLASS ACTION WAIVER . To the extent permissible by law, there shall be no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated as a class action or collective action (“Class Action Waiver ”). THIS MEANS THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPLICITL Y PROVIDED HEREIN, ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES THAT ARISE, OR HAVE ARISEN, OUT OF EXECUTIVE’S EMPLOYMENT OR THE TERMINA TION OF THE EXECUTIVE’S EMPLOYMENT SHALL PROCEED IN ARBITRA TION SOLEL Y ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND THAT THE ARBITRA TOR’S AUTHORITY TO RESOL VE ANY DISPUTE AND TO MAKE WRITTEN AWARDS WILL BE LIMITED T O THE EXECUTIVE’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS. (f) REPRESENT ATIVE ACTION WAIVER . To the extent permissible by law, there shall be no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated as a representative action or as a private attorney general action, including but not limited to claims brought pursuant to the Private Attorney General Act of 2004, Cal.

THE ARBITRA TOR’S AUTHO RITY TO RESOL VE ANY DISPUTE AND TO MAKE WRITTEN AWARDS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE EXECUTIVE’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS. (g) The Parties agree that only a court of competent jurisdiction may interpret this Section 9 and resolve challenges to its validity and enforceability , including but not limited to the validity , enforceability and interpretation of the Class Action Waiver and Representative Action Waiver . The arbitrator shall have no jurisdiction or power to make such determinations. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, shall govern the interpretatio n and enforcement of the duty to arbitrate found in this Section 9 and all arbitration proceedings under this Agreement. (h) Any conﬂict between the rules and procedures set forth in either the JAMS or AAA rules and those set forth in this Agreement shall be resolved in favor of those in this Agreement.

Severability . The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, void or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed modiﬁed, amended and narrowed to the extent necessary to render such provision legal, valid and enforceable, and the other remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected but shall remain in full force and effect. If a court of competent jurisdiction ﬁnds the Class Action Waiver and/or Representative Action Waiver in Section 9 is unenforceable for any reason, then the unenforceable waiver provision shall be severable from this Agreement, and any claims covered by any deemed unenforceable waiver provision may only be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the remainder of the Agreement shall be binding and enforceable.

Upon termination of my employment with the Company, regardless of the reason for such termination, I will return to the Company all documents and other materials of any kind that contain Conﬁdential Information.

During my employment with the Company, and if I leave the Company for any reason whatsoever, then for a period of twelve (12) months after my separation from the Company, I will not directly or indirectly solicit, induce or attempt to inﬂuence any associate to leave the employment of the Company, nor will I in any way assist anyone else in doing the things I myself cannot do. Further, I agree that during my employment with the Company, and for a period of twelve (12) months after my separation from the Company for any reason whatsoever, I will not directly or indirectly recruit, solicit or otherwise induce or attempt to inﬂuence any customer, supplier, sales representative, lender, lessor, lessee or any other person having a business relationship with the Company to discontinue or reduce the extent of that relationship, nor will I in any way assist anyone else in doing the things I myself cannot do. 3. I agree that all inventions, designs, original works of authorship, and ideas conceived, produced, created, or reduced to practice, either solely or jointly with others, during my employment with the Company, including those developed on my own time, which relate to or are useful in the Company’s business (“Intellectual Property”) shall be owned solely by the Company. I understand that whether in preliminary or ﬁnal form, such Intellectual Property includes, for example, A-1 16/04/2025, 06:54 Document https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036958 29/30all ideas, inventions, discoveries, designs, creative works, formulas, innovations, improvements, trade secrets, and other intellectual property. All Intellectual Property is either work made for hire for the Company within the meaning of the U. S.

I agree it is in and will remain in the company’s sole discretion as to whether any or all of the Intellectual Property should be protected including, but not limited to, by registering it with any patent, trademark, and/or copyright ofﬁce. I will, without any additional consideration, execute all documents and take all other actions needed to convey my complete ownership of the Intellectual Property to the Company so that the Company may own and protect such Intellectual Property and obtain patent, copyright and trademark registrations for it. I agree to provide reasonable assistance to the Company in the event the Company decides to pursue patent, trademark, and/or Copyright protection for the Intellectual Property or in the event the Company needs to engage in enforcement actions with respect to the Intellectual Property. I agree that the Company may alter or modify the Intellectual Property at the Company’s sole discretion, and I waive all right to claim or disclaim authorship. I represent and warrant that any Intellectual Property that I assign to the Company, except as otherwise disclosed in writing at the time of assignment, will be my sole, exclusive, original work.

I understand that the Company at its sole discretion may waive this provision or shorten the twelve (12) month period by giving me a written waiver. 5. I understand that the Company is entitled, in addition to other remedies, to obtain an injunction against any potential or actual violation of this Agreement.

This Agreement supersedes any prior versions of a conﬁdentiality, noncompetition and intellectual property agreement I may have signed during my employment.

The COBRA Payment shall be paid (i) on the First Payment Date and (ii) regardless of whether the Executive elects COBRA continuation coverage under the Company’ s group health plan; (d) The Company shall pay the Executive any incentive compensation under the IC Plan as follows: (i) the incentive compensation that the Executive would have received for the season which includes the Executive’ s Termination Date if the Executive had remained employed with the Company through the completion of such season, pro-rated to such Termination Date and based on actual performance; and (ii) the incentive compensation under the IC Plan that the Executive would have received if the Executive had remained employe d with the Company for a period of two (2) years (i.e., the next four (4) seasons under the IC Plan) after the Termination Date based on actual performance, less applicable withholding, subject to the terms of the IC Plan. The foregoing payments shall be paid at the same time as payments under the IC Plan are typically paid, but in no event later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the applicable season is completed; andt h Exhibit I-216/04/2025, 06:54 Document https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036958 8/3016/04/2025, 06:54 Document https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036958 9/30(e) The treatment of any outstanding equity awards shall be determined as follows: (i) A pro-rata portion of the outstanding unvested equity awards that are held by the Executive as of the Termination Date and vest only based on the passage of time shall vest and be settled on the First Payment Date, which pro-rata vesting shall be determined by (A) multiplying (x) the number of shares subject to the award by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of complete months between the ﬁrst day of the applicable time-based vesting period and the Termination Date, and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of months in the time-based vesting period, less (B) the number of shares subject to the award that had already vested pursuant to the award’ s terms prior to the Termination Date, if any; (ii) A pro-rata portion of the outstan ding unvested equity awards that are held by the Executive as of the Termination Date and vest based, at least in part, on the satisfaction of performance goals shall vest and be settled promptly following the end of the performance period, but in any event not earlier than the First Payment Date or later than the end of the calendar year in which the performance period ends, which pro-rata vesting shall be determined by (A) multiplying the number of shares that the Executive would have earned for the entire performance period based on the level of performance determined in accordance with the applicable plan and award agreements by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of complete months between the ﬁrst day of the applicable performance period and the Termination Date, and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of months in the performance period (or vesting period, if longer); (iii) To the extent that any outstanding unvested equity award that is held by the Executive as of the Termination Date would vest at a greater percentage under the terms of the applicable plan and award agreement than as provided for under Sections 4(e)(i)-(ii), the terms of such award agreement shall instead determine the number of shares covered by such equity award that will vest under this Section 4(e), subject to Sections 4(e)(iv)-(v); (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no equity awards that are outstanding as of the Termination Date will be forfeited during the three (3)-month period commencing upon the Termination Date, provided, that, (x) to the extent a Change in Control occurs during such three (3)- month period, any such equity awards that are outstanding and unve sted as of the Change in Control will instead be treated in accordance with Section 5; and (y) to the extent a Change in Control does not occur during such three (3)-month period, any portion of the equity awards outstanding as of Termination Date that do not vest pursuant to Sections 4(e)(i)-(iii) shall be forfeited; and (v) To the extent that the payment or settlement of any equity awards in accordance with the foregoing would constitute an impermissible change in the time or form of payment under Section 409A of the Code, then such portion shall be payable at a time that would be permitted under Section 409A of the Code and that is as near as possible to the payment timing contemplated by the foregoing. 5. Severance Upon a Qualifying Termination Within the Protection Period . If the Executive has a Qualifying Termination within the Protection Period, then, subject to Section 6, the Company will provide the Executive with the following (collectively , the “Change in Control Severance Beneﬁts ”): (a) The payments and beneﬁts described in Sections 4(a), (b), and (c); provided, however , that if the Termination Date occurs during the portion of the Protection Period that occurs on or following a Change in Control, and such Change in Control is a Change in Control Event, then the total of the salary continuation amounts described in Section 4(b) will Exhibit I-316/04/2025, 06:54 Document https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036958 10/3016/04/2025, 06:54 Document https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036958 11/30instead be paid to the Executive in a single lump sum, less applicable withholding, on the First Payment Date; (b) A payment equal to the sum of the incentive compensation payouts that the Executive actually received under the IC Plan for the four (4) completed seasons immediately preceding the Termination Date, with the amount of any payout that is prorated with respect to any seasonal incentive period in which the Executive was not employed by the Company for the entirety of such incentive period to be annualized (the “Bonus Amount ”); provided, however , that if, as of the Executive’ s Termination Date, the Executive has not been employed for a long enough period to have been eligible for four (4) seasons of incentive compensa tion payouts under the IC Plan, the seasonal target incentive award opportunity applicable to the Executive as of immediately prior to the Termination Date shall be used for purposes of calculating the Bonus Amount for any season during which the Executive was not eligible for a payout under IC Plan solely as a result of the Executive’ s date of commencement of employment. The Bonus Amount shall be paid, less applicable withholding, in a lump sum cash payment on the First Payment Date; (c) A payment equal to the produc t of (i) the average of the incentive compensation payouts that the Executive actually received under the IC Plan for the four (4) completed seasons immediately preceding the Executiv e’s Termination Date, with the amount of any payout that is prorated with respect to any seasonal incentive period in which the Executive was not employed by the Company for the entirety of such incentive period to be annualized and, if, as of the Executive’ s Termination Date, the Executive has not been employed for a long enough period to have been eligible for four (4) seasons of incentive compensation payouts under the IC Plan, then for purposes of such average, the seasonal target incentive award opportunity applicable to the Executive as of immediately prior to the Termination Date shall be used for any season in which the Executive was not eligible for a payout under IC Plan solely as a result of the Executive’ s date of commencement of employment, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the season (within the meaning of the IC Plan) in which the Termination Date occurs that elapsed through the Termination Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such season. The foregoing payment, less applicable withholding, shall be paid on the First Payment Date; (d) If any action at law, in equity , or arbitration, including an action for declaratory relief, is brought by the Executive to obtain or enforce any rights provided by this Section 5, the Company shall pay or reimburse the Executive for all documented legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the Executive in such action. Such amounts shall be paid or reimbursed on a monthly basis for expenses incurred in the preceding month; provided that the Executive will be required to promptly repay to the Company any amounts paid or reimbursed under this paragraph to the extent an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Executive’ s position in such action is frivolous or in bad faith; and (e) All of the outstanding and unvested equity awards held by the Executive immediately before such Qualifying Termination will immediately become fully vested and payable on the First Payment Date, provided that, to the extent that paying any portion of such amount in accordance with the foregoing would constitute an impermissible change in the time or form of payment under Section 409A of the Code, then such portion shall be payable at a time that would be permitted under Section 409A of the Code and that is as near as possible to the payment timing contemplated by the foregoing. To the extent that an equity award vests based on the achievement of performance goals, performance goals will be deemed to be achieved at target levels if less than one-third of the applicable performance period has elapsed as of the date of the Change in Control, otherwise performance goals will be deemed to be achieved at maximum levels. Exhibit I-416/04/2025, 06:54 Document https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036958 12/30(f) In the event that the Termination Date occurs during the portion of the Protection Period that precedes a Change in Control and the Executive has already commenced receiving payments and/or beneﬁts under Section 4 prior to the Change in Control, then the Executive will be entitled to the payments and beneﬁts under this Section 5 in lieu of any additional payments or beneﬁts under Section 4, but only to the extent an equivalent payment and/or beneﬁt has not already been paid or provided pursuant to Section 4. 6. Release Requirement . Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary , the Company shall not make or provide the Severance Beneﬁts or the Change in Control Severance Beneﬁts (in each case, other than the Accrued Amounts) or waive its rights under Section 7(e) unless the Executive timely executes and delivers to the Company a release of claims in favor of the Company , its afﬁliates and their respective ofﬁcers and directors in a form provided by the Company (the “Release ”) and such Release becomes effective and irrevocable within sixty (60) days following the Executive’ s Termination Date. If the foregoing requirements are not satisﬁed by the Executive, then no Severance Beneﬁts nor Change in Control Severance Beneﬁts (in each case, other than the Accrued Amounts) shall be due to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement. 7. Effect on Other Plans, Agreements and Beneﬁts . (a) Any severance beneﬁts payable to the Executive under this Agreement will be in lieu of and not in addition to: (i) any severance beneﬁts to which the Executive would otherwise be entitled under any general severance policy or severance plan maintained by the Company or any agreement between the Executive and the Company that provides for severance beneﬁts (for the avoidance, other than any special written retention agreements); and (ii) any salary continuation provided for under the Conﬁdentiality , Noncompetition and Intellectual Property Agreement. (b) Any severance beneﬁts payable to the Executive under this Agree ment will not be counted as compensation for purposes of determining beneﬁts under any other beneﬁt policies or plans of the Company , except to the extent expressly provided therein. (c) The Executive’ s entitlement to any other beneﬁts not expressly referenced herein shall be determined in accordance with the applicable employee beneﬁt plans then in ef fect. (d) The Executive expressly agrees that any amounts the Executive may owe to the Company as of the Termination Date may be deducted from the amount s that the Company would otherwise owe to the Executive under this Agreement, subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. (e) Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other agreement to the contrary , if the Executive incurs a Termination for Cause, then all Variable Compensation shall be immediately canceled for no consideration. (f) The Executive will be subject to the Company’ s clawback policies in effect from time to time, if such policies are also applicable to all other executive ofﬁcers of the Company on the same terms. 8. Section 280G of the Code . (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary , if the Executive is a “disqualiﬁed individual” (as deﬁned in Section 280G(c) of the Code) and the payments and beneﬁts provided for in this Agreement, together with any other payments and beneﬁts which the Exhibit I-516/04/2025, 06:54 Document https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036958 13/30Executive has the right to receive from the Company or any other person, would constitute a “parachute payment” (as deﬁned in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code), then the payments and beneﬁts provided for in this Agreement will be either (a) reduced (but not below zero) so that the present value of such total amount s and beneﬁts received by the Executive from the Company and/or such person(s) will be $1.00 less than three (3) times the Executive’ s “base amount” (as deﬁned in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) and so that no portion of such amounts and beneﬁts received by the Executive will be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or (b) paid in full, whichever produces the better “net after-tax” economic position to the Executive (taking into account any applicable excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code and any other applicable taxes). (b) The reduction of payments and beneﬁts hereunder , if applicable, will be made by determining the Parachute Payment Ratio (as deﬁned below) for each payment or beneﬁt then reducing the total payments and beneﬁts in order , beginning with the payment or beneﬁt with the highest Parachute Payment Ratio. Payments or beneﬁts with the same Parachute Payment Ratio will be reduced based on the time of payment, with the latest payments or beneﬁts reduced ﬁrst. Payments or beneﬁts with the same Parachute Payment Ratio and the same time of payment will be reduced proportionately . For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Parachute Payment Ratio ” shall mean a fraction, (a) the numerator of which is the value of the applicable payment or beneﬁt, as calculated for purposes of Sectio n 280G of the Code, and (b) the denominator of which is the intrinsic (i.e., economic) value of such payment or beneﬁt. (c) The determination as to whether any such reduction in the amount of the payments and beneﬁts provided hereunder is necessary will be made applying principles, assumptions and procedures consistent with Section 280G of the Code by an accounting ﬁrm or law ﬁrm of national reputation that is selected for this purpose by the Com pany in its sole discretion (the “280G Firm”). In order to assess whether payments under this Agreement or otherwise qualify as reasonable compensation that is exempt from being a parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code, the 280G Firm or the Company may retain the services of an independent valuation expert. (d) If a reduced payment or beneﬁt is made or provided in accordance with this Section 8 and through error or otherwise that payment or beneﬁt, when aggregated with other payments and beneﬁts from the Company used in determining if a “parachute payment” exists, exceeds $1.00 less than three (3) times the Executive’ s base amount , then the Executive must immediately repay such excess to the Company upon notiﬁcation that an overpayment has been made. Nothing in this Section 8 will require the Company to be responsible for, or have any liability or obligation with respect to, the Executive’ s excise tax liabilities under Section 4999 of the Code. 9. Arbitration and Class and Representative Action W aiver . (a) The Parties agree that, subject to Section 9(b), any controversy or claim between the Company and the Executive arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its termination shall be settled and determined by a single arbitrator whose award shall be accepted as ﬁnal and binding upon the Parties. If the Executive initiates arbitration, the Executive will be responsible for paying one-half of the ﬁling fee. Each Party will be responsible for their own attorney’ s fees, subject to Section 5(d). The Parties shall jointly select an arbitrator from JAMS, Inc. (“JAMS ”) or the American Arbitration Associ ation (“AAA”) with at least ten (10) years of experience in employment disputes.

(c) This Agreement also does not prevent the Executive from ﬁling a claim or charge with a federal, state or local administrative agency , such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, or similar state or local agencies. (d) This Agreement does not prohibit those limited circumstances under which either Party ﬁnds it necessary to seek emergency or temporary injunctive relief, such as a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order , from a court that may be necessary to protect any rights or property of either Party pending the establishment of the arbitral tribunal or its determination of the merits of the dispute.

THIS MEANS THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPLICITL Y PROVIDED HEREIN, ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES THAT ARISE, OR HAVE ARISEN, OUT OF EXECUTIVE’S EMPLOYMENT OR THE TERMINA TION OF THE EXECUTIVE’S EMPLOYMENT SHALL PROCEED IN ARBITRA TION SOLEL Y ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND THAT THE ARBITRA TOR’S AUTHORITY TO RESOL VE ANY DISPUTE AND TO MAKE WRITTEN AWARDS WILL BE LIMITED T O THE EXECUTIVE’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS. (f) REPRESENT ATIVE ACTION WAIVER . To the extent permissible by law, there shall be no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated as a representative action or as a private attorney general action, including but not limited to claims brought pursuant to the Private Attorney General Act of 2004, Cal. Lab. Code § 2698, et seq. (“Representative Action Waiver ”).

THE ARBITRA TOR’S AUTHO RITY TO RESOL VE ANY DISPUTE AND TO MAKE WRITTEN AWARDS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE EXECUTIVE’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS. (g) The Parties agree that only a court of competent jurisdiction may interpret this Section 9 and resolve challenges to its validity and enforceability , including but not limited to the validity , enforceability and interpretation of the Class Action Waiver and Representative Action Waiver . The arbitrator shall have no jurisdiction or power to make such determinations.

Severability . The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, void or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed modiﬁed, amended and narrowed to the extent necessary to render such provision legal, valid and enforceable, and the other remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected but shall remain in full force and effect. If a court of competent jurisdiction ﬁnds the Class Action Waiver and/or Representative Action Waiver in Section 9 is unenforceable for any reason, then the unenforceable waiver provision shall be severable from this Agreement, and any claims covered by any deemed unenforceable waiver provision may only be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the remainder of the Agreement shall be binding and enforceable.

THEREFORE, in consideration of my employment or continued employment with the Company and my right to participate in certain Company incentive plans and in recognition of the highly competitive nature of the business conducted by the Company, I agree as follows: 1.

I understand that Conﬁdential Information includes all information and materials relating to Intellectual Property, as deﬁned below, the Company’s trade secrets and all information relating to the Company that the Company has not made available to the public. By way of example, Conﬁdential Information includes information about the Company’s products, formulas, designs, processes, advertising, marketing, promotional plans, technical procedures, strategies, ﬁnancial information, and many other types of information and materials. Upon termination of my employment with the Company, regardless of the reason for such termination, I will return to the Company all documents and other materials of any kind that contain Conﬁdential Information. I will not use any conﬁdential information of any third party, including any prior employer, in the course of my work for the Company. This provision does not prohibit me from cooperating with the EEOC or any other state or local fair employment practices agency; from reporting possible violations of federal or state law or regulations to any governmental entity, including but not limited to the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission; from making other disclosures protected under applicable whistleblower provisions of federal or state law or regulations; or from disclosing the underlying facts and circumstances of allegations of discrimination, sexual harassment or retaliation.

During my employment with the Company, and if I leave the Company for any reason whatsoever, then for a period of twelve (12) months after my separation from the Company, I will not directly or indirectly solicit, induce or attempt to inﬂuence any associate to leave the employment of the Company, nor will I in any way assist anyone else in doing the things I myself cannot do. Further, I agree that during my employment with the Company, and for a period of twelve (12) months after my separation from the Company for any reason whatsoever, I will not directly or indirectly recruit, solicit or otherwise induce or attempt to inﬂuence any customer, supplier, sales representative, lender, lessor, lessee or any other person having a business relationship with the Company to discontinue or reduce the extent of that relationship, nor will I in any way assist anyone else in doing the things I myself cannot do. 3. I agree that all inventions, designs, original works of authorship, and ideas conceived, produced, created, or reduced to practice, either solely or jointly with others, during my employment with the Company, including those developed on my own time, which relate to or are useful in the Company’s business (“Intellectual Property”) shall be owned solely by the Company. I understand that whether in preliminary or ﬁnal form, such Intellectual Property includes, for example, A-1 16/04/2025, 06:54 Document https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1036958 29/30all ideas, inventions, discoveries, designs, creative works, formulas, innovations, improvements, trade secrets, and other intellectual property. All Intellectual Property is either work made for hire for the Company within the meaning of the U. S. Copyright Act, or, if such Intellectual Property is determined not to be work made for hire, then I hereby and herein irrevocably assign all right, title and interest in and to the Intellectual Property to the Company, including, but not limited to, all copyrights, patents, and/or trademarks. I agree it is in and will remain in the company’s sole discretion as to whether any or all of the Intellectual Property should be protected including, but not limited to, by registering it with any patent, trademark, and/or copyright ofﬁce. I will, without any additional consideration, execute all documents and take all other actions needed to convey my complete ownership of the Intellectual Property to the Company so that the Company may own and protect such Intellectual Property and obtain patent, copyright and trademark registrations for it. I agree to provide reasonable assistance to the Company in the event the Company decides to pursue patent, trademark, and/or Copyright protection for the Intellectual Property or in the event the Company needs to engage in enforcement actions with respect to the Intellectual Property. I agree that the Company may alter or modify the Intellectual Property at the Company’s sole discretion, and I waive all right to claim or disclaim authorship. I represent and warrant that any Intellectual Property that I assign to the Company, except as otherwise disclosed in writing at the time of assignment, will be my sole, exclusive, original work. I conﬁrm that I have not previously invented any Intellectual Property, or I have advised the Company in writing of any prior inventions or ideas. 4. If I leave the Company for any reason whatsoever, then for a period of twelve (12) months after my separation from the Company, I will not, directly or indirectly, work for or contribute to the efforts of any business organization that competes in the United States, or plans to compete in the United States, with the Company or its products. I understand that the Company at its sole discretion may waive this provision or shorten the twelve (12) month period by giving me a written waiver. 5. I understand that the Company is entitled, in addition to other remedies, to obtain an injunction against any potential or actual violation of this Agreement. Further, I understand that nothing in this Agreement shall cancel or modify any right I have to receive compensation upon my termination of employment that has been agreed to in any previous agreement. 6. I agree that the Company may assign this Agreement without my consent, and agree that the rights of the Company hereunder shall inure to the beneﬁt of its successors and assigns. I may not assign this Agreement, as the obligations hereunder are personal to me. 7. This Agreement cannot be modiﬁed unless the Company agrees in writing and this Agreement will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with Ohio law. 8. This Agreement supersedes any prior versions of a conﬁdentiality, noncompetition and intellectual property agreement I may have signed during my employment.

W I T N E S S E T H: WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive are parties to a certain Employment Agreement dated as of January 2, 2023 (the “Existing Employment Agreement”); WHEREAS, the Executive is and has been a valuable executive of the Company and an integral part of its management team; and WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to amend and restate the Existing Employment Agreement in its entirety to set forth the terms and conditions of the Executive’s continued employment with the Company. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained, the parties agree as follows: 1. Employment. (a) The Company hereby employs the Executive as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and the Executive hereby accepts such employment, on the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth. (b) During the term of this Employment Agreement, the Executive shall be and have the title of Chief Financial Officer of the Company and shall devote his entire business time and all reasonable efforts to his employment in that capacity with such other duties as may be reasonably requested from time to time by the Board of Directors of the Company, which duties shall be consistent with such position. For service as an officer and employee of the Company, the Company agrees that the Executive shall be entitled to the full protection of the applicable indemnification provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of the Corporation (including the provisions for advances), as the same may be amended from time to time. 2. Compensation. The Company will pay the Executive the salary and bonus and provide the benefits set forth in Exhibit A to this Employment Agreement. 3. Term.

(a) Death or Retirement. This Employment Agreement will terminate upon the Executive’s death or retirement. (b) Disability. The Company may terminate this Employment Agreement upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice in the event of the Executive’s “disability.” For purposes of this Employment Agreement, the Executive’s “disability” shall be deemed to have occurred only after one hundred fifty (150) days in the aggregate during any consecutive twelve (12) month period, or after one hundred twenty (120) consecutive days, during which one hundred fifty (150) or one hundred twenty (120) days, as the case may be, the Executive, by reason of his physical or mental disability or illness, shall have been unable to substantially discharge his duties under this Employment Agreement. The date of disability shall be such one hundred fiftieth (150th) or one hundred twentieth (120th) day, as the case may be. In the event either the Company or the Executive, after receipt of notice of the Executive’s disability from the other, disputes whether the Executive’s disability shall have occurred, the Executive shall promptly submit to a physical examination by the chief of medicine of any major accredited hospital in the Buffalo, New York area and, unless such physician shall issue his written statement to the effect that in his opinion, based on his diagnosis, the Executive is capable of resuming his employment and devoting his full time and energy to discharging his duties within thirty (30) days after the date of such statement, such permanent disability shall be deemed to have occurred. (c) Cause. The Company may terminate this Employment Agreement for “cause.” For purposes of this Employment Agreement, “cause” shall mean: (i) The Executive’s fraud, commission of a felony, commission of an act or series of acts of dishonesty which are materially inimical to the best interests of the Company, or the Executive’s willful and substantial failure to perform his duties under this Employment Agreement, which failure has not been cured within a reasonable time (which shall not be less than thirty (30) days) after the Company gives notice thereof to the Executive; (ii) The Executive’s material breach of any material provision of this Employment Agreement which breach, if capable of being cured, has not been cured in all substantial respects within thirty (30) days) after the Company gives notice thereof to the Executive; or (iii) The Executive’s commission of an act of moral turpitude, dishonesty or fraud which would in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the “Board”) render his continued employment materially damaging or detrimental to the Company. (d) Termination Without Cause. The Company may terminate this Employment Agreement without Cause by notifying the Executive in writing of its election to terminate at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of termination. The Executive may, on written notice to the Company, accelerate the effective date of termination to any other date of his choosing up to the date of notice of acceleration. 216/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.2 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029105 2/14(e) Termination for Good Reason. The Executive may terminate this Employment Agreement for “Good Reason,” which shall mean the occurrence of one or more of the following events without his consent; provided that, in the case of events described in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), the Executive shall give the Company a written notice, within 90 days following the initial occurrence of the event, describing the event that the Executive claims to be Good Reason and stating the Executive’s intention to terminate employment unless the Company takes appropriate corrective action: “Good Reason” shall exist if: (i) the Company materially changes the Executive’s duties and responsibilities as set forth in this Employment Agreement or changes his title or position; (ii) the Executive’s place of employment or the principal executive offices of the Company are located more than fifty (50) miles from the geographical center of Williamsville, New York; (iii) the Company materially diminishes the salary, fringe benefits or other compensation being paid to the Executive; (iv) there occurs a material breach by the Company of any of its obligations under this Employment Agreement; or (v) the failure of any successor of the Company to furnish the assurances provided for in Section 7(c). In the case of events described in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), the Company shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the written notice from the Executive stating his claim of Good Reason in which to take appropriate corrective action (the “Cure Period”). If the Company does not cure the Good Reason during such Cure Period, the Good Reason will be deemed to have occurred at the end of the Cure Period, and the Executive must resign within the thirty (30)-day period following the end of such Cure Period. (f) Termination By Mutual Agreement. This Employment Agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of the Company and the Executive. (g) Resignation. The Executive may terminate this Employment Agreement at any time with sixty (60) days’ written notice to the Company, and the Company may accelerate the effective date of termination to any other date up to the date of notice of acceleration. (h) Payment of Compensation Due. Regardless of how the Executive’s employment is terminated, (i) the Company will pay the Executive, on the effective date of termination or, if permitted by applicable law, as soon as administratively feasible following the effective date of termination, but in any event within fifteen (15) days thereafter, any accrued but unpaid salary through the date of the Executive’s effective date of termination, any accrued but unused vacation, any earned but unpaid bonus, and reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Executive through the date of termination but not yet paid to the Executive; and (ii) additionally, the Executive shall receive any other compensation or benefits that have vested through the effective date of termination or to which the Executive may be entitled in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions of each grant, award or plan. 316/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.2 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029105 3/145. Severance Payments. (a) Termination Without Cause or for Good Reason. The Company will make the severance payments specified in Section 5(b) below if this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 4(d) (without Cause) or 4(e) (for Good Reason) hereof. In addition, the employee health and welfare benefits referred to in Exhibit A, Section 1(c) for the Executive (and the Executive’s eligible dependents) shall be continued for a period of thirty (30) months after termination of employment upon substantially the same terms as provided to the Executive (and the Executive’s eligible dependents) immediately before the Executive’s Separation from Service (including with respect to subsidization of the premiums by the Company); provided, however, that this continuation is not intended to reduce the amount of time that the Executive may obtain coverage at his own expense under the provision of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (“COBRA”), and comparable state law, except that the Executive’s coverage for such thirty (30)-month period shall be counted against and deducted from the maximum COBRA period (if the applicable maximum COBRA period is eighteen (18) months, then following the Executive’s coverage hereunder, the Executive shall be entitled to no further COBRA coverage under the Company’s group health plans). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Executive’s (or the Executive’s eligible dependents’) participation in any such employee health and welfare benefits is not possible after the effective date of termination under the general terms and provisions of such employee health and welfare benefits or would give rise to penalties, the Company shall arrange to provide the Executive (and the Executive’s eligible dependents) with benefits substantially similar to those which the Executive (and the Executive’s eligible dependents) is entitled to receive under such employee health and welfare benefits or, alternatively, pay a lump sum amount equal to the reasonable value of such substantially similar benefits (with such lump sum payment to be made within sixty (60) days following the Executive’s Separation from Service, or if later, within sixty (60) days following a determination that such continued coverage is not possible or would give rise to penalties). (b) Severance. (i) Non-Change in Control Severance. In the event this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 4(d) (without Cause) or Section 4(e) (for Good Reason) prior to, or more than two years after, a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company or a Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company, the Company will pay the Executive an aggregate amount equal to two (2) times the sum of: (1) the Executive’s annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service (not taking into account any reduction to the Executive’s base salary that formed a basis for Good Reason); plus (2) the bonus earned with respect to the calendar year immediately prior to the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service (provided, that for purposes of this Employment Agreement, the bonus deemed earned for the 2022 calendar year and paid in 2023 shall be $675,000) (collectively, the “Non-Change in Control Severance”). 416/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.2 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029105 4/14(ii) Change in Control Severance. In the event this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 4(d) (without Cause) or Section 4(e) (for Good Reason) at the time of or within two years after a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company or a Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company, the Company will pay the Executive an aggregate amount equal to the sum of: (1)two and a half (2.5) times the sum of: A. the greater of: i. the Executive’s annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the first to occur of a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company or the Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company, or ii. the Executive’s annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service (not taking into account any reduction to the Executive’s base salary that formed a basis for Good Reason); plus B. the greater of: i. the bonus earned with respect to the calendar year immediately prior to the first to occur of a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company or a Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company that has been paid or would have been paid in the year of the Section 409A Change in Control of the Company or the Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company, as applicable (provided, that for purposes of this Employment Agreement, the bonus deemed earned for the 2022 calendar year and paid in 2023 shall be $675,000), or ii. the bonus earned with respect to the calendar year immediately prior to the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service that has been paid or would have otherwise been paid for the year of the Executive’s Separation from Service had the Executive’s employment not been terminated (such greater amount pursuant to this subsection (B), the “Bonus Amount”); and, 516/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.2 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029105 5/14(2) an amount equal to (A) the Bonus Amount, multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days the Executive was employed by the Company from the first day of the calendar year in which the Separation from Service occurred (for the avoidance of doubt, including the day of the Executive’s Separation from Service), and the denominator of which is the number of total days in the calendar year. (c) Severance Payments Without Change in Control. Except as set forth in Section 5(d) below, the severance payable pursuant to Section 5(b)(i) shall be paid in thirty (30) equal monthly payments, each in an amount equal to 1/30th of the aggregate amount of the severance payments. The thirty (30) monthly payments described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed a series of separate payments within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii). The first six monthly payments shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum within 30 days following his Separation from Service. The remaining twenty-four (24) monthly payments shall be paid to the Executive in twenty-four (24) separate payments on the first day of twenty-four (24) successive calendar months, with the first payment occurring on the first day of the seventh calendar month beginning after the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service. The parties affirm that it is their intent that the first six monthly payments be excluded from the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) by reason of the “short-term deferral” rule set forth at Treasury Regulation §1.409A-1(b)(4). (d) Severance Payments With Change in Control. (i) Section 409A Change in Control. If this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 4(d) (without Cause) or Section 4(e) (for Good Reason) within two years after a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company has occurred, or if a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company occurs while the Company is making Non-Change in Control Severance payments, the Executive shall receive the applicable severance payments specified in Section 5(b)(ii) (or the remaining balance thereof) in a lump sum. The lump sum shall be paid within thirty (30) days after the effective date of the Executive’s Separation from Service or, if the Section 409A Change in Control occurs after the Executive’s Separation from Service, within thirty (30) days after such Section 409A Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicable severance payments specified in Section 5(b)(ii) shall not be paid to the Executive (except for the lump sum equal to six monthly payments provided in the third sentence of Section 5(c)) before the day following the six (6)-month anniversary of the Executive’s Separation from Service unless the Executive shall have received an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Executive that payment before that date will not be a violation of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) (concerning the six (6)-month delay rule). In the event that the Executive shall fail to obtain such an opinion of counsel, the Company or its successor shall, within thirty (30) days after the later of the Executive’s Separation from Service or the Section 409A Change in Control, transfer the remaining balance of the monthly payments due the Executive to a rabbi trust (similar to the trust described in Revenue Procedure 92-64) under a trust agreement that requires payment of such remaining balance to the Executive in a lump sum on the day following the six (6)-month anniversary of the Executive’s Separation from Service. 616/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.2 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029105 6/14(ii) Non-Section 409A Change in Control. If this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 4(d) (without Cause) or Section 4(e) (for Good Reason) within two years after a Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company has occurred, or if a Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company occurs while the Company is making Non-Change in Control Severance payments to the Executive pursuant to Section 5(b) and 5(c), the Company or its successor shall, within thirty (30) days after the Non-Section 409A Change in Control, transfer the remaining balance of the monthly payments due the Executive to a rabbi trust (similar to the trust described in Revenue Procedure 92-64) under a trust agreement that requires payment of such remaining balance to the Executive from the trust in accordance with the original payment schedule under Section 5(c). (e) Reimbursement of Legal Fees and Expenses. The Company shall also reimburse the Executive (promptly upon documented request), the amount of all legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the Executive in connection with any good faith claim for severance compensation hereunder, including all such fees and expenses incurred in contesting or disputing, by arbitration or otherwise, any such termination or in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Employment Agreement or in connection with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to the application of Section 4999 of the Code to any payment or benefit provided hereunder. (f) No Obligation to Mitigate Damages. The Executive shall be under no obligation to mitigate damages with respect to termination and in the event the Executive is employed or receives income from any other source there shall be no offset therefor against the amounts due from the Company hereunder. (g) Section 280G – Best After Tax Result. In the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by the Executive pursuant to this Employment Agreement or otherwise (“Payments”) would (i) constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this Section 5(g), be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, any successor provisions, or any comparable federal, state, local of foreign excise tax (the “Excise Tax”), then such Payments shall be either (A) provided in full pursuant to the terms of this Employment Agreement or any other applicable plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (B) provided as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such Payments being subject to the Excise Tax (the “Reduced Amount”), whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state, local and foreign income, employment and other taxes and the Excise Tax (including without limitation, any interest or penalties on such taxes), results in the receipt by the Executive, on an after tax-basis, of the greatest amount of payments and benefits provided for hereunder or otherwise, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax. In the event of a reduction of Payments, the Payments shall be reduced in the following order, in each case, in reverse chronological order beginning with the Payments that are to be paid furthest in time from consummation of the transaction that is subject to Section 280G of the Code: (i) cash payments not subject to Section 409A of the Code; (ii) cash payments subject to Section 409A of the Code; (iii) equity-based payments and acceleration; and (iv) non-cash forms of benefits. 716/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.2 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029105 7/146.

Accordingly, it is acknowledged that, upon adequate proof of the Executive’s violation of any legally enforceable provision of this Section 6, the Company shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach. (c) The Executive has carefully considered the nature and extent of the restrictions upon him and the rights and remedies conferred upon the Company under this Section 6, and hereby acknowledges and agrees that the same are reasonable in time and territory, are designed to eliminate competition which otherwise would be unfair to the Company, do not stifle the inherent skill and experience of the Executive, would not operate as a bar to the Executive’s sole means of support, are fully required to protect the legitimate interests of the Company and do not confer a benefit upon the Company disproportionate to the detriment to the Executive. 816/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.2 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029105 8/147.

(d) Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Employment Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association then pertaining in the City of Buffalo, New York, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator or arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator or arbitrators shall be deemed to possess the powers to issue mandatory orders and restraining orders in connection with such arbitration; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7(d) shall be construed so as to deny the Company the right and power to seek and obtain injunctive relief in a court of equity for any breach or threatened breach by the Executive of any of his covenants contained in Section 6 hereof.

(f) The failure of either party to enforce any provision or provisions of this Employment Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision or provisions as to any future violations thereof, nor prevent that party thereafter from enforcing each and every other provision of this Employment Agreement. The rights granted the parties herein are cumulative and the waiver of any single remedy shall not constitute a waiver of such party’s right to assert all other legal remedies available to it under the circumstances. (g) This Employment Agreement supersedes any prior agreements and understandings between the parties and may not be modified or terminated orally. No modification, termination or attempted waiver shall be valid unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the same is sought to be enforced. 916/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.2 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029105 9/14(h) This Employment Agreement shall be governed by and construed according to the laws of the State of New York.

Upon the expiration of the applicable deferral period, any payments which would have otherwise been made during that period (whether in a single sum or in installments) in the absence of this paragraph shall be paid to the Executive or the Executive’s beneficiary in one lump sum (without interest).

The Company may terminate this Employment Agreement upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice in the event of the Executive’s “disability.” For purposes of this Employment Agreement, the Executive’s “disability” shall be deemed to have occurred only after one hundred fifty (150) days in the aggregate during any consecutive twelve (12) month period, or after one hundred twenty (120) consecutive days, during which one hundred fifty (150) or one hundred twenty (120) days, as the case may be, the Executive, by reason of his physical or mental disability or illness, shall have been unable to substantially discharge his duties under this Employment Agreement.

The Company may terminate this Employment Agreement for “cause.” For purposes of this Employment Agreement, “cause” shall mean: (i) The Executive’s fraud, commission of a felony, commission of an act or series of acts of dishonesty which are materially inimical to the best interests of the Company, or the Executive’s willful and substantial failure to perform his duties under this Employment Agreement, which failure has not been cured within a reasonable time (which shall not be less than thirty (30) days) after the Company gives notice thereof to the Executive; (ii) The Executive’s material breach of any material provision of this Employment Agreement which breach, if capable of being cured, has not been cured in all substantial respects within thirty (30) days) after the Company gives notice thereof to the Executive; or (iii) The Executive’s commission of an act of moral turpitude, dishonesty or fraud which would in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the “Board”) render his continued employment materially damaging or detrimental to the Company. 216/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.1 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029104 2/14(d) Termination Without Cause.

(e) Termination for Good Reason. The Executive may terminate this Employment Agreement for “Good Reason,” which shall mean the occurrence of one or more of the following events without his consent; provided that, in the case of events described in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), the Executive shall give the Company a written notice, within 90 days following the initial occurrence of the event, describing the event that the Executive claims to be Good Reason and stating the Executive’s intention to terminate employment unless the Company takes appropriate corrective action: “Good Reason” shall exist if: (i) the Company materially changes the Executive’s duties and responsibilities as set forth in this Employment Agreement or changes his title or position; (ii) the Executive’s place of employment or the principal executive offices of the Company are located more than fifty (50) miles from the geographical center of Williamsville, New York; (iii) the Company materially diminishes the salary, fringe benefits or other compensation being paid to the Executive; (iv) there occurs a material breach by the Company of any of its obligations under this Employment Agreement; or (v) the failure of any successor of the Company to furnish the assurances provided for in Section 7(c).

The Executive may terminate this Employment Agreement at any time with sixty (60) days’ written notice to the Company, and the Company may accelerate the effective date of termination to any other date up to the date of notice of acceleration. 316/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.1 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029104 3/14(h) Payment of Compensation Due. Regardless of how the Executive’s employment is terminated, (i) the Company will pay the Executive, on the effective date of termination or, if permitted by applicable law, as soon as administratively feasible following the effective date of termination, but in any event within fifteen (15) days thereafter, any accrued but unpaid salary through the date of the Executive’s effective date of termination, any accrued but unused vacation, any earned but unpaid bonus, and reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Executive through the date of termination but not yet paid to the Executive; and (ii) additionally, the Executive shall receive any other compensation or benefits that have vested through the effective date of termination or to which the Executive may be entitled in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions of each grant, award or plan. 5. Severance Payments. (a) Termination Without Cause or for Good Reason. The Company will make the severance payments specified in Section 5(b) below if this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 4(d) (without Cause) or 4(e) (for Good Reason) hereof. In addition, the employee health and welfare benefits referred to in Exhibit A, Section 1(c) for the Executive (and the Executive’s eligible dependents) shall be continued for a period of thirty (30) months after termination of employment upon substantially the same terms as provided to the Executive (and the Executive’s eligible dependents) immediately before the Executive’s Separation from Service (including with respect to subsidization of the premiums by the Company); provided, however, that this continuation is not intended to reduce the amount of time that the Executive may obtain coverage at his own expense under the provision of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (“COBRA”), and comparable state law, except that the Executive’s coverage for such thirty (30)-month period shall be counted against and deducted from the maximum COBRA period (if the applicable maximum COBRA period is eighteen (18) months, then following the Executive’s coverage hereunder, the Executive shall be entitled to no further COBRA coverage under the Company’s group health plans). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Executive’s (or the Executive’s eligible dependents’) participation in any such employee health and welfare benefits is not possible after the effective date of termination under the general terms and provisions of such employee health and welfare benefits or would give rise to penalties, the Company shall arrange to provide the Executive (and the Executive’s eligible dependents) with benefits substantially similar to those which the Executive (and the Executive’s eligible dependents) is entitled to receive under such employee health and welfare benefits or, alternatively, pay a lump sum amount equal to the reasonable value of such substantially similar benefits (with such lump sum payment to be made within sixty (60) days following the Executive’s Separation from Service, or if later, within sixty (60) days following a determination that such continued coverage is not possible or would give rise to penalties). (b) Severance. (i) Non-Change in Control Severance. In the event this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 4(d) (without Cause) or Section 4(e) (for Good Reason) prior to, or more than two years after, a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company or a Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company, the Company will pay the Executive an aggregate amount equal to two (2) times the sum of: (1) the Executive’s annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service (not taking into account any reduction to the Executive’s base salary that formed a basis for Good Reason); plus 416/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.1 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029104 4/14(2) the bonus earned with respect to the calendar year immediately prior to the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service (collectively, the “Non-Change in Control Severance”). (ii) Change in Control Severance. In the event this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 4(d) (without Cause) or Section 4(e) (for Good Reason) at the time of or within two years after a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company or a Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company, the Company will pay the Executive an aggregate amount equal to the sum of: (1)two and a half (2.5) times the sum of: A. the greater of: i. the Executive’s annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the first to occur of a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company or the Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company, or ii. the Executive’s annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service (not taking into account any reduction to the Executive’s base salary that formed a basis for Good Reason); plus B. the greater of: i. the bonus earned with respect to the calendar year immediately prior to the first to occur of a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company or a Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company that has been paid or would have been paid in the year of the Section 409A Change in Control of the Company or the Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company, as applicable, or ii. the bonus earned with respect to the calendar year immediately prior to the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service that has been paid or would have otherwise been paid for the year of the Executive’s Separation from Service had the Executive’s employment not been terminated (such greater amount pursuant to this subsection (B), the “Bonus Amount”); and 516/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.1 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029104 5/14(2) an amount equal to (A) the Bonus Amount, multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days the Executive was employed by the Company from the first day of the calendar year in which the Separation from Service occurred (for the avoidance of doubt, including the day of the Executive’s Separation from Service), and the denominator of which is the number of total days in the calendar year. (c) Severance Payments Without Change in Control. Except as set forth in Section 5(d) below, the severance payable pursuant to Section 5(b)(i) shall be paid in thirty (30) equal monthly payments, each in an amount equal to 1/30th of the aggregate amount of the severance payments. The thirty (30) monthly payments described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed a series of separate payments within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii). The first six monthly payments shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum within 30 days following his Separation from Service. The remaining twenty-four (24) monthly payments shall be paid to the Executive in twenty-four (24) separate payments on the first day of twenty-four (24) successive calendar months, with the first payment occurring on the first day of the seventh calendar month beginning after the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service. The parties affirm that it is their intent that the first six monthly payments be excluded from the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) by reason of the “short-term deferral” rule set forth at Treasury Regulation §1.409A-1(b)(4). (d) Severance Payments With Change in Control. (i) Section 409A Change in Control. If this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 4(d) (without Cause) or Section 4(e) (for Good Reason) within two years after a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company has occurred, or if a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company occurs while the Company is making Non-Change in Control Severance payments, the Executive shall receive the applicable severance payments specified in Section 5(b)(ii) (or the remaining balance thereof) in a lump sum. The lump sum shall be paid within thirty (30) days after the effective date of the Executive’s Separation from Service or, if the Section 409A Change in Control occurs after the Executive’s Separation from Service, within thirty (30) days after such Section 409A Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicable severance payments specified in Section 5(b)(ii) shall not be paid to the Executive (except for the lump sum equal to six monthly payments provided in the third sentence of Section 5(c)) before the day following the six (6)-month anniversary of the Executive’s Separation from Service unless the Executive shall have received an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Executive that payment before that date will not be a violation of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) (concerning the six (6)-month delay rule). In the event that the Executive shall fail to obtain such an opinion of counsel, the Company or its successor shall, within thirty (30) days after the later of the Executive’s Separation from Service or the Section 409A Change in Control, transfer the remaining balance of the monthly payments due the Executive to a rabbi trust (similar to the trust described in Revenue Procedure 92-64) under a trust agreement that requires payment of such remaining balance to the Executive in a lump sum on the day following the six (6)-month anniversary of the Executive’s Separation from Service. 616/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.1 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029104 6/14(ii) Non-Section 409A Change in Control. If this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 4(d) (without Cause) or Section 4(e) (for Good Reason) within two years after a Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company has occurred, or if a Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company occurs while the Company is making Non-Change in Control Severance payments to the Executive pursuant to Section 5(b) and 5(c), the Company or its successor shall, within thirty (30) days after the Non-Section 409A Change in Control, transfer the remaining balance of the monthly payments due the Executive to a rabbi trust (similar to the trust described in Revenue Procedure 92-64) under a trust agreement that requires payment of such remaining balance to the Executive from the trust in accordance with the original payment schedule under Section 5(c). (e) Reimbursement of Legal Fees and Expenses. The Company shall also reimburse the Executive (promptly upon documented request), the amount of all legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the Executive in connection with any good faith claim for severance compensation hereunder, including all such fees and expenses incurred in contesting or disputing, by arbitration or otherwise, any such termination or in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Employment Agreement or in connection with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to the application of Section 4999 of the Code to any payment or benefit provided hereunder. (f) No Obligation to Mitigate Damages. The Executive shall be under no obligation to mitigate damages with respect to termination and in the event the Executive is employed or receives income from any other source there shall be no offset therefor against the amounts due from the Company hereunder. (g) Section 280G – Best After Tax Result. In the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by the Executive pursuant to this Employment Agreement or otherwise (“Payments”) would (i) constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this Section 5(g), be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, any successor provisions, or any comparable federal, state, local of foreign excise tax (the “Excise Tax”), then such Payments shall be either (A) provided in full pursuant to the terms of this Employment Agreement or any other applicable plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (B) provided as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such Payments being subject to the Excise Tax (the “Reduced Amount”), whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state, local and foreign income, employment and other taxes and the Excise Tax (including without limitation, any interest or penalties on such taxes), results in the receipt by the Executive, on an after tax-basis, of the greatest amount of payments and benefits provided for hereunder or otherwise, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax. In the event of a reduction of Payments, the Payments shall be reduced in the following order, in each case, in reverse chronological order beginning with the Payments that are to be paid furthest in time from consummation of the transaction that is subject to Section 280G of the Code: (i) cash payments not subject to Section 409A of the Code; (ii) cash payments subject to Section 409A of the Code; (iii) equity-based payments and acceleration; and (iv) non-cash forms of benefits. 716/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.1 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029104 7/146.

The arbitrator or arbitrators shall be deemed to possess the powers to issue mandatory orders and restraining orders in connection with such arbitration; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7(d) shall be construed so as to deny the Company the right and power to seek and obtain injunctive relief in a court of equity for any breach or threatened breach by the Executive of any of his covenants contained in Section 6 hereof. (e) Any notice to be given under this Employment Agreement shall be personally delivered in writing or shall have been deemed duly given when received after it is posted in the United States mail, postage prepaid, registered or certified, return receipt requested, and if mailed to the Company, shall be addressed to the principal place of business of the Corporation and the Partnership, attention: Chief Executive Officer, and if mailed to the Executive, shall be addressed to him at his home address last known on the records of the Company, or at such other address or addresses as either the Company or the Executive may hereafter designate in writing to the other.

The rights granted the parties herein are cumulative and the waiver of any single remedy shall not constitute a waiver of such party’s right to assert all other legal remedies available to it under the circumstances. 916/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.1 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029104 9/14(g) This Employment Agreement supersedes any prior agreements and understandings between the parties and may not be modified or terminated orally.

W I T N E S S E T H: WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive are parties to a certain Employment Agreement dated as of January 1, 2022 (the “Existing Employment Agreement”); WHEREAS, the Executive is and has been a valuable executive of the Company and an integral part of its management team; and WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to amend and restate the Existing Employment Agreement in its entirety to set forth the terms and conditions of the Executive’s continued employment with the Company. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained, the parties agree as follows: 1. Employment. (a) The Company hereby employs the Executive as Chief Operating Officer of the Company, and the Executive hereby accepts such employment, on the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth. (b) During the term of this Employment Agreement, the Executive shall be and have the title of Chief Operating Officer of the Company and shall devote his entire business time and all reasonable efforts to his employment in that capacity with such other duties as may be reasonably requested from time to time by the Board of Directors of the Company, which duties shall be consistent with such position. For service as an officer and employee of the Company, the Company agrees that the Executive shall be entitled to the full protection of the applicable indemnification provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of the Corporation (including the provisions for advances), as the same may be amended from time to time. 2. Compensation. The Company will pay the Executive the salary and bonus and provide the benefits set forth in Exhibit A to this Employment Agreement. 3. Term.

(a) Death or Retirement. This Employment Agreement will terminate upon the Executive’s death or retirement. (b) Disability. The Company may terminate this Employment Agreement upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice in the event of the Executive’s “disability.” For purposes of this Employment Agreement, the Executive’s “disability” shall be deemed to have occurred only after one hundred fifty (150) days in the aggregate during any consecutive twelve (12) month period, or after one hundred twenty (120) consecutive days, during which one hundred fifty (150) or one hundred twenty (120) days, as the case may be, the Executive, by reason of his physical or mental disability or illness, shall have been unable to substantially discharge his duties under this Employment Agreement. The date of disability shall be such one hundred fiftieth (150th) or one hundred twentieth (120th) day, as the case may be. In the event either the Company or the Executive, after receipt of notice of the Executive’s disability from the other, disputes whether the Executive’s disability shall have occurred, the Executive shall promptly submit to a physical examination by the chief of medicine of any major accredited hospital in the Buffalo, New York area and, unless such physician shall issue his written statement to the effect that in his opinion, based on his diagnosis, the Executive is capable of resuming his employment and devoting his full time and energy to discharging his duties within thirty (30) days after the date of such statement, such permanent disability shall be deemed to have occurred. (c) Cause. The Company may terminate this Employment Agreement for “cause.” For purposes of this Employment Agreement, “cause” shall mean: (i) The Executive’s fraud, commission of a felony, commission of an act or series of acts of dishonesty which are materially inimical to the best interests of the Company, or the Executive’s willful and substantial failure to perform his duties under this Employment Agreement, which failure has not been cured within a reasonable time (which shall not be less than thirty (30) days) after the Company gives notice thereof to the Executive; (ii) The Executive’s material breach of any material provision of this Employment Agreement which breach, if capable of being cured, has not been cured in all substantial respects within thirty (30) days) after the Company gives notice thereof to the Executive; or (iii) The Executive’s commission of an act of moral turpitude, dishonesty or fraud which would in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the “Board”) render his continued employment materially damaging or detrimental to the Company. (d) Termination Without Cause. The Company may terminate this Employment Agreement without Cause by notifying the Executive in writing of its election to terminate at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of termination. The Executive may, on written notice to the Company, accelerate the effective date of termination to any other date of his choosing up to the date of notice of acceleration. 216/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.3 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029106 2/14(e) Termination for Good Reason. The Executive may terminate this Employment Agreement for “Good Reason,” which shall mean the occurrence of one or more of the following events without his consent; provided that, in the case of events described in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), the Executive shall give the Company a written notice, within 90 days following the initial occurrence of the event, describing the event that the Executive claims to be Good Reason and stating the Executive’s intention to terminate employment unless the Company takes appropriate corrective action: “Good Reason” shall exist if: (i) the Company materially changes the Executive’s duties and responsibilities as set forth in this Employment Agreement or changes his title or position; (ii) the Executive’s place of employment or the principal executive offices of the Company are located more than fifty (50) miles from the geographical center of Williamsville, New York; (iii) the Company materially diminishes the salary, fringe benefits or other compensation being paid to the Executive; (iv) there occurs a material breach by the Company of any of its obligations under this Employment Agreement; or (v) the failure of any successor of the Company to furnish the assurances provided for in Section 7(c). In the case of events described in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), the Company shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the written notice from the Executive stating his claim of Good Reason in which to take appropriate corrective action (the “Cure Period”). If the Company does not cure the Good Reason during such Cure Period, the Good Reason will be deemed to have occurred at the end of the Cure Period, and the Executive must resign within the thirty (30)-day period following the end of such Cure Period. (f) Termination By Mutual Agreement. This Employment Agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of the Company and the Executive. (g) Resignation. The Executive may terminate this Employment Agreement at any time with sixty (60) days’ written notice to the Company, and the Company may accelerate the effective date of termination to any other date up to the date of notice of acceleration. (h) Payment of Compensation Due. Regardless of how the Executive’s employment is terminated, (i) the Company will pay the Executive, on the effective date of termination or, if permitted by applicable law, as soon as administratively feasible following the effective date of termination, but in any event within fifteen (15) days thereafter, any accrued but unpaid salary through the date of the Executive’s effective date of termination, any accrued but unused vacation, any earned but unpaid bonus, and reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Executive through the date of termination but not yet paid to the Executive; and (ii) additionally, the Executive shall receive any other compensation or benefits that have vested through the effective date of termination or to which the Executive may be entitled in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions of each grant, award or plan. 316/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.3 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029106 3/145. Severance Payments. (a) Termination Without Cause or for Good Reason. The Company will make the severance payments specified in Section 5(b) below if this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 4(d) (without Cause) or 4(e) (for Good Reason) hereof. In addition, the employee health and welfare benefits referred to in Exhibit A, Section 1(c) for the Executive (and the Executive’s eligible dependents) shall be continued for a period of thirty (30) months after termination of employment upon substantially the same terms as provided to the Executive (and the Executive’s eligible dependents) immediately before the Executive’s Separation from Service (including with respect to subsidization of the premiums by the Company); provided, however, that this continuation is not intended to reduce the amount of time that the Executive may obtain coverage at his own expense under the provision of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (“COBRA”), and comparable state law, except that the Executive’s coverage for such thirty (30)-month period shall be counted against and deducted from the maximum COBRA period (if the applicable maximum COBRA period is eighteen (18) months, then following the Executive’s coverage hereunder, the Executive shall be entitled to no further COBRA coverage under the Company’s group health plans). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Executive’s (or the Executive’s eligible dependents’) participation in any such employee health and welfare benefits is not possible after the effective date of termination under the general terms and provisions of such employee health and welfare benefits or would give rise to penalties, the Company shall arrange to provide the Executive (and the Executive’s eligible dependents) with benefits substantially similar to those which the Executive (and the Executive’s eligible dependents) is entitled to receive under such employee health and welfare benefits or, alternatively, pay a lump sum amount equal to the reasonable value of such substantially similar benefits (with such lump sum payment to be made within sixty (60) days following the Executive’s Separation from Service, or if later, within sixty (60) days following a determination that such continued coverage is not possible or would give rise to penalties). (b) Severance. (i) Non-Change in Control Severance. In the event this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 4(d) (without Cause) or Section 4(e) (for Good Reason) prior to, or more than two years after, a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company or a Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company, the Company will pay the Executive an aggregate amount equal to two (2) times the sum of: (1) the Executive’s annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service (not taking into account any reduction to the Executive’s base salary that formed a basis for Good Reason); plus (2) the bonus earned with respect to the calendar year immediately prior to the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service (collectively, the “Non-Change in Control Severance”). 416/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.3 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029106 4/14(ii) Change in Control Severance. In the event this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 4(d) (without Cause) or Section 4(e) (for Good Reason) at the time of or within two years after a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company or a Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company, the Company will pay the Executive an aggregate amount equal to the sum of: (1)two and a half (2.5) times the sum of: A. the greater of: i. the Executive’s annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the first to occur of a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company or the Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company, or ii. the Executive’s annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service (not taking into account any reduction to the Executive’s base salary that formed a basis for Good Reason); plus B. the greater of: i. the bonus earned with respect to the calendar year immediately prior to the first to occur of a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company or a Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company that has been paid or would have been paid in the year of the Section 409A Change in Control of the Company or the Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company, as applicable, or ii. the bonus earned with respect to the calendar year immediately prior to the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service that has been paid or would have otherwise been paid for the year of the Executive’s Separation from Service had the Executive’s employment not been terminated (such greater amount pursuant to this subsection (B), the “Bonus Amount”); and (2) an amount equal to (A) the Bonus Amount, multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days the Executive was employed by the Company from the first day of the calendar year in which the Separation from Service occurred (for the avoidance of doubt, including the day of the Executive’s Separation from Service), and the denominator of which is the number of total days in the calendar year. 516/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.3 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029106 5/14(c) Severance Payments Without Change in Control. Except as set forth in Section 5(d) below, the severance payable pursuant to Section 5(b)(i) shall be paid in thirty (30) equal monthly payments, each in an amount equal to 1/30th of the aggregate amount of the severance payments. The thirty (30) monthly payments described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed a series of separate payments within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii). The first six monthly payments shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum within 30 days following his Separation from Service. The remaining twenty-four (24) monthly payments shall be paid to the Executive in twenty-four (24) separate payments on the first day of twenty-four (24) successive calendar months, with the first payment occurring on the first day of the seventh calendar month beginning after the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service. The parties affirm that it is their intent that the first six monthly payments be excluded from the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) by reason of the “short-term deferral” rule set forth at Treasury Regulation §1.409A-1(b)(4). (d) Severance Payments With Change in Control. (i) Section 409A Change in Control. If this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 4(d) (without Cause) or Section 4(e) (for Good Reason) within two years after a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company has occurred, or if a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company occurs while the Company is making Non-Change in Control Severance payments, the Executive shall receive the applicable severance payments specified in Section 5(b)(ii) (or the remaining balance thereof) in a lump sum. The lump sum shall be paid within thirty (30) days after the effective date of the Executive’s Separation from Service or, if the Section 409A Change in Control occurs after the Executive’s Separation from Service, within thirty (30) days after such Section 409A Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicable severance payments specified in Section 5(b)(ii) shall not be paid to the Executive (except for the lump sum equal to six monthly payments provided in the third sentence of Section 5(c)) before the day following the six (6)-month anniversary of the Executive’s Separation from Service unless the Executive shall have received an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Executive that payment before that date will not be a violation of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) (concerning the six (6)-month delay rule). In the event that the Executive shall fail to obtain such an opinion of counsel, the Company or its successor shall, within thirty (30) days after the later of the Executive’s Separation from Service or the Section 409A Change in Control, transfer the remaining balance of the monthly payments due the Executive to a rabbi trust (similar to the trust described in Revenue Procedure 92-64) under a trust agreement that requires payment of such remaining balance to the Executive in a lump sum on the day following the six (6)-month anniversary of the Executive’s Separation from Service. 616/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.3 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029106 6/14(ii) Non-Section 409A Change in Control. If this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 4(d) (without Cause) or Section 4(e) (for Good Reason) within two years after a Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company has occurred, or if a Non-Section 409A Change in Control of the Company occurs while the Company is making Non-Change in Control Severance payments to the Executive pursuant to Section 5(b) and 5(c), the Company or its successor shall, within thirty (30) days after the Non-Section 409A Change in Control, transfer the remaining balance of the monthly payments due the Executive to a rabbi trust (similar to the trust described in Revenue Procedure 92-64) under a trust agreement that requires payment of such remaining balance to the Executive from the trust in accordance with the original payment schedule under Section 5(c). (e) Reimbursement of Legal Fees and Expenses. The Company shall also reimburse the Executive (promptly upon documented request), the amount of all legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the Executive in connection with any good faith claim for severance compensation hereunder, including all such fees and expenses incurred in contesting or disputing, by arbitration or otherwise, any such termination or in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Employment Agreement or in connection with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to the application of Section 4999 of the Code to any payment or benefit provided hereunder. (f) No Obligation to Mitigate Damages. The Executive shall be under no obligation to mitigate damages with respect to termination and in the event the Executive is employed or receives income from any other source there shall be no offset therefor against the amounts due from the Company hereunder. (g) Section 280G – Best After Tax Result. In the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by the Executive pursuant to this Employment Agreement or otherwise (“Payments”) would (i) constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this Section 5(g), be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, any successor provisions, or any comparable federal, state, local of foreign excise tax (the “Excise Tax”), then such Payments shall be either (A) provided in full pursuant to the terms of this Employment Agreement or any other applicable plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (B) provided as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such Payments being subject to the Excise Tax (the “Reduced Amount”), whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state, local and foreign income, employment and other taxes and the Excise Tax (including without limitation, any interest or penalties on such taxes), results in the receipt by the Executive, on an after tax-basis, of the greatest amount of payments and benefits provided for hereunder or otherwise, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax. In the event of a reduction of Payments, the Payments shall be reduced in the following order, in each case, in reverse chronological order beginning with the Payments that are to be paid furthest in time from consummation of the transaction that is subject to Section 280G of the Code: (i) cash payments not subject to Section 409A of the Code; (ii) cash payments subject to Section 409A of the Code; (iii) equity-based payments and acceleration; and (iv) non-cash forms of benefits. 716/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.3 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029106 7/146.

Accordingly, it is acknowledged that, upon adequate proof of the Executive’s violation of any legally enforceable provision of this Section 6, the Company shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach. (c) The Executive has carefully considered the nature and extent of the restrictions upon him and the rights and remedies conferred upon the Company under this Section 6, and hereby acknowledges and agrees that the same are reasonable in time and territory, are designed to eliminate competition which otherwise would be unfair to the Company, do not stifle the inherent skill and experience of the Executive, would not operate as a bar to the Executive’s sole means of support, are fully required to protect the legitimate interests of the Company and do not confer a benefit upon the Company disproportionate to the detriment to the Executive. 816/04/2025, 06:58 EX-10.3 https://mcc.law.stanford.edu/capi/ﬁle/1029106 8/147.

In the event that Executive experiences an Involuntary Termination immediately at or after a Change in Control, the Company shall work with the surviving company to ensure that any payments due to Executive under subsection (c) above be paid upon the closing of the Change in Control. In addition, if at any time the parties agree that a Good Reason arises after the Change in Control and severance is due to Executive under subsection (c), the Company shall work with the surviving company to insure that any such payments due to Executive are paid promptly after such Good Reason arises.

The Company shall pay all JAMS arbitration fees in excess of the administrative fees that you would be required to pay if the dispute were decided in a court of law. The parties shall be responsible for paying their own attorneys’ fees and all other costs they incur related to any arbitration proceeding, except to the extent that applicable law provides for the shifting or the recovery of such fees and costs. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent either you or the Company from obtaining injunctive relief in court to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any such arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, and any awards or orders in such arbitrat ions may be entered and enforced as judgments in the federal and state courts of any competent jurisdiction.
