      "power or without proper authority. In a similar vein, it is imperative to examine whether the \n",

      "2) \n",
      "The said reliefs are as follows; \n",
      "a) Grant a Writ of Certiorari dismissing the order delivered for M/1192/20 \n",

      "c) Grant a Writ of Prohibition prohibiting further initial hearing of the case \n",
      "M/1192/20 by the District Judge, District Court of Kesbawa. \n",
      "d) Grant an interim order restraining the District Judge, District Court of \n",
      "Kesbawa from hearing the case M/1192/20 until the final determination \n",
      "of this matter.   \n",
      " \n",
      "Facts of the Petitioner’s Case  \n",
      "3) \n",
      "The Petitioner has submitted a petition with 54 paragraphs running into \n",
      "73 pages.  On perusal of paragraphs 1 to 53, the Petitioner’s contention is \n",
      "that the District Judge had not given a hearing to the Petitioner and had \n",
      "violated the Principles of Natural Justice. \n",
      "4) \n",
      "Therefore, the said District Judge serving as a District Judge will cause \n",
      "severe damage to the parties who are seeking justice before him. \n",
      "5) \n",
      "Further, he had stated that even being an Attorney-at-Law his case had \n",
      "been heard unlawfully, if in the event an ordinary citizen had appeared, \n",
      "the injustice caused would be irreparable. \n",
      "6) \n",
      "In addition, the complaints made by the Petitioner in respect of the \n",
      "prayers sought in the case is that the District Judge has decided the order \n",
      "in favour of the Defendants in case No: N/1192/20 of the District Court of \n",
      "Kesbawa to be quashed and invalidated and to issue an interim order \n",
      "against the said District Judge not to hear the aforesaid case. \n",
      "7) \n",
      "When referring to the paragraphs 4 to 9 of the petition, the Petitioner’s \n",
      "complaint was that the District Judge has given a 59 day gap to show \n",
      "cause for not issuing interim orders against the Defendants and had not \n",
      "considered the request and objections raised by the Petitioner. \n",
      "8) \n",
      "Furthermore, it was alleged that the District Judge had arbitrarily used \n",
      "his discretion, made favorable arrangements for the Defendants and had \n",
      "not given a fair hearing to the Petitioner. \n",
      "9) \n",
      "The District Judge was biased towards the Defendants and had noted the \n",
      "details incorrectly when delivering the order. Further, he had given several \n",

      " \n",
      " 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "dates to submit their written submissions which have caused a reasonable \n",
      "suspicion for the Petitioner of the Independence of the Judiciary. \n",
      "10) \n",
      "In the other paragraphs of the said petition, the Petitioner had repeated \n",
      "the same facts.  In addition the Petitioner has contended that the \n",
      "Petitioner has drawn the attention of the District Judge towards \n",
      "inconvenience encountered with the court staff.  However, the District \n",
      "Judge has failed to consider the request made by the Petitioner. \n",
      "11) \n",
      "It is also contended that when the Petitioner drew the attention of the \n",
      "Court towards the fraudulent documents tendered by the Defendants, the \n",
      "District Judge failed to take any action. \n",
      "12) \n",
      "Although the Defendants have misled the Court, the District Judge has \n",
      "given biased orders in favour of the Defendants. \n",
      "13) \n",
      "On the aforesaid grounds, the Petitioner had sought to issue notice and \n",
      "interim orders against the Respondents. \n",

      "Disputed Facts \n",
      " \n",
      "14) \n",
      "This case was supported by the Petitioner on 4th December 2023 and \n",
      "sought formal notice against the Respondents.  The Counsels appeared for \n",
      "the 2nd and 3rd Respondents and the Deputy Solicitor General appeared for \n",
      "the 5th Respondent objected for issuing notice against the Respondents. \n",
      "15) \n",
      "After hearing the submissions, this case was fixed for the order to be \n",
      "delivered on 12th January 2024. \n",
      "16) \n",
      "In considering the petition, documents and the submissions made by the \n",
      "Counsels to issue notice, the following disputed facts need to be \n",
      "addressed. \n",

      "Is there sufficient material to maintain a Writ Application against the 1st \n",
      "Respondent that he was biased towards the Defendant in M/1192/20 \n",
      "and is it a matter to be decided in a different forum? \n",
      "IV. \n",
      "Is there sufficient material to prove that the 1st Respondent considered \n",

      "I. \n",

      "Respondent and the relevant order challenged by the Petitioner was \n",
      "delivered by the 1st Respondent. \n",

      "The main contention of the Petitioner is that the 1st Respondent acted bias \n",

      "favourable arrangements for the Defendants. \n",

      "After the arrest of the appellant, the said manna knife had been recovered based \n",

      "to cause such injuries. \n",
      "When called for a defence at the conclusion of the prosecution evidence, the \n",

      "that there was no basis to come to such a conclusion.  \n",
      "Thereafter, the learned High Court Judge has considered whether the action of \n",

The appellant was found guilty of causing the death of Sirisena Perera on December 28, 1993. During the appeal, the appellant's counsel questioned whether the prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt but ultimately conceded the absence of grounds for appeal. The prosecution presented witness testimony, including that of an eyewitness who described the fatal incident involving a 'manna knife.' The High Court considered whether the appellant acted under provocation or self-defense but found no sufficient evidence to support these claims. The trial court's findings and the evidence presented led to the conclusion that the appeal lacked merit. Thus, the appeal was dismissed, and the original conviction and sentence were affirmed.\"\n",

      "  \"summary\": \"The appeal was filed by Mahawage Calistus Perera alias Jude against a conviction for murder, with sentencing to death following a trial by the High Court of Gampaha. The appellant was found guilty of causing the death of Sirisena Perera on December 28, 1993. During the appeal, the appellant's counsel questioned whether the prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt but ultimately conceded the absence of grounds for appeal. The prosecution presented witness testimony, including that of an eyewitness who described the fatal incident involving a 'manna knife.' The High Court considered whether the appellant acted under provocation or self-defense but found no sufficient evidence to support these claims. The trial court's findings and the evidence presented led to the conclusion that the appeal lacked merit. Thus, the appeal was dismissed, and the original conviction and sentence were affirmed.\",\n",

      "violation of the said interim order. The Petitioners contend that the \n",

      " \n",
      "Page 5 of 10 \n",
      " \n",

      "As the matters remain such, on or about 18.01.2022, by a notice marked P13 \n",

      "permanently close two gates towards the southern side of their property and \n",
      "take necessary action to regularize the boundary wall by obtaining the \n",
      "relevant approval. The Petitioners state that the aforementioned premises \n",
      "and the boundary wall of the said premises were built approximately in 1962 \n",
      "pursuant to obtaining the necessary approvals from the 1st Respondent and \n",
      "the Petitioners continuously enjoyed the peaceful possession of the said \n",
      "constructions. The Petitioners claim that they are unaware of any violation of \n",
      "Municipal Council Regulations pertaining to the said construction and have \n",
      "not ostensibly violated any such regulations. It is claimed that the impugned \n",
      "Notice P13 manifested a lengthy gap of over 60 years from the above \n",
      "constructions. Therefore, the Petitioners claim that the said notice is ultra \n",
      "vires, unreasonable, in violation of principles of natural justice and legitimate \n",
      "expectations. Under such circumstances, the Petitioners invoke the \n",
      "jurisdiction of this Court moving this Court to issue a Writ of Certiorari to \n",
      "quash Notice P13, Writs of Prohibition prohibiting the Respondents from \n",
      "taking any steps in pursuant to Notice P13. \n",
      "The Respondents claim that the filling station situated at Park Avenue had \n",
      "been in existence since 1980’s. The Petitioners came to ownership of the \n",
      "impugned property in 1992 and yet made no move to object or protest \n",
      "against the installation of said filling station until as late as 2017. The CMC \n",
      "claims that the said land containing the said fuel station and several other \n",
      "lands surrounding the land bordering the Petitioners’ property from the south \n",
      "have been lawfully vested with CMC. The vehicles belonging to CMC are \n",
      "parked on lands owned by the CMC and said vehicles are momentarily parked \n",
      "on the sides of the public roads in order to discharge their duties. Further, the \n",
      "Respondents vehemently deny acting in breach of the interim order. The \n",
      "Respondents state that the Petitioners have purported to install two gates \n",
      "along the southern boundary wall of the Petitioner's land bordering the state \n",
      "land which has been vested with the CMC. The Respondents claim that no \n",
      "person can lawfully construct a gate opening into someone else’s property \n",
      " \n",
      "Page 6 of 10 \n",
      " \n",
      "and that an authorized gate can only be open to a public road or sanctioned \n",
      "private road. The Respondent’s position is that no approval has been obtained \n",
      "prior to the construction of the boundary wall and that the long-term \n",
      "occupation of the property cannot be used to cover up or rectify illegality. \n",
      "Therefore, it is advanced that the said gates are completely unauthorized and \n",
      "unlawful structures. The Respondents submits that at all times required they \n",
      "have acted according to the applicable laws, rules and regulations. \n",
      "The Respondents claim that the boundary wall of the Petitioners’ premises \n",
      "No. 15 & No. 15 1/1 of Campbell Park Avenue, Colombo 08 and the two \n",
      "entrances installed therein are unauthorized. The Petitioners claim that the \n",
      "boundary wall of the said premises was built approximately 1962, upon all \n",
      "necessary approvals being obtained from the 1st Respondent. Thus, it is \n",
      "necessary to consider the required procedure to be applied in the \n",
      "construction of said walls and entrances within the Municipal Council limits.  \n",
      "It is on common ground that the property owned by the Petitioners is situated \n",
      "within the Colombo Municipal Council area. Section 5 of the Housing and \n",
      "Town Improvement Ordinance, No.19 of 1915 which was repealed by the \n",
      "Urban Development Authority Law stipulates that no building shall be erected \n",

      "approval granted by the Respondent to construct the boundary walls and \n",
      "three gates if any by the Director (City Planning) of the 1st Respondent by \n",
      "letter marked P13. The Respondents state that the Petitioners have failed to \n",
      "produce any evidence to demonstrate that such approval has been obtained. \n",
      "Further, neither the Petitioners' housing plan prepared in 1962 (P15(a)), nor \n",
      "the condominium plan prepared in 1982 (P15(b)) indicate a wall or gate so \n",
      "approved. The Respondents contend that the mere occupation of the \n",
      "premises for a long period by the Petitioners could not be used to cover up or \n",
      "rectify any illegal construction constructed. \n",
      "However, the copies of the Street Line Certificate of the Condominium Plan \n",
      "and the Condominium Plan for the impugned premises no. 15 and no.15 1/1, \n",
      "Park Avenue have been submitted by the Petitioners to this Court and the \n",
      "same are marked as P15(e) & P15(g). The Respondents have submitted the \n",
      " \n",
      "Page 7 of 10 \n",
      " \n",
      "same documents also marked as R8 & R8(a). According to the said documents \n",
      "southern boundary of premises no.15 & no.15 1/1 is described as the \n",
      "“southern walls of this lot”. The said Condominium Plan had been prepared \n",
      "on the 2nd of January 1983. Therefore, it is evident from the same that the \n",
      "impugned boundary wall on the southern boundary of the subject property \n",
      "has been in existence since 1983. The Respondents further contend that the \n",
      "recent Plan dated 16.06.2020 (R10) only shows one gate to the southern \n",
      "boundary and therefore the second gate has been erected even after the said \n",
      "Plan R10 was prepared in 2020. Nevertheless, when R10 is carefully and \n",
      "closely perused, it is apparent that more than one gate had existed on the \n",
      "southern boundary of the Petitioners’ property. Further, it is evident that the \n",
      "Director of the City Planning Division of the 1st Respondent had authorized \n",
      "the boundary wall which is depicted in document R8/P15(e) as the Southern \n",
      "boundary of premises no 15 & 15 1/1, Park Avenue by issuing a street line \n",
      "certification to the R8/P15(e) as referred therein. \n",
      "The fact that the Condominium Plan of the Petitioner had been approved is \n",
      "not in dispute. Further, the said Condominium Plan refers to the wall as the \n",
      "southern boundary of the subject premises.  In terms of Section 3A of the \n",
      "Apartment Law, in order for a Condominium Plan to be registered it is \n",
      "mandatory that the application for such registration be accompanied with the \n",
      "certificate of conformity issued by the relevant local authority within whose \n",
      "limits the land is situated and empowered to approve the building plan. Said \n",
      "Section stipulates as follows: \n",
      "3A.1(a) Every application for the registration of a Condominium Plan, shall be made \n",

      "granted in respect of the building plan depicted in the R8/P15(e) which \n",

      "stipulated in 1R4, which reads thus; \n",
      "1. Medical knowledge:- Good. \n",
      " \n",
      "2. Clinical Skills:- Average. Trainee takes a special interest in taking \n",
      "histories from young females, especially the social history. He becomes too \n",
      "personal with female patients and with female bystanders. During the ward \n",
      "rounds, the trainee tends to present imaginary examination findings and \n",
      "investigation reports which made it difficult to rely on his case \n",
      "presentations. \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "3. Communication skills:- Officers’s communication skills are extremely \n",
      "good. He is fluent in English. Mostly this skill is misused to mislead others \n",
      "to cover the shortcomings of the trainee in a very successful manner. The \n",
      "trainee would try to talk in-depth even of patients he has not seen. The \n",
      "trainee would telephone from his home to the Consultant and would talk \n",
      "pretending he was talking by the bedside of the patient. When the trainee \n",
      "is asked for excuses for wrongdoing, he could very successfully fabricate a \n",
      "story in a convincing manner.  \n",
      " \n",
      "4. Skills in patient management and procedures:- Average. He neglected \n",
      "to check the blood pressure of patients at the neurology clinic, in spite of \n",
      "repeated advice.  \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "5. Attitude and commitment to work and participation at educational \n",
      "activities:- The trainee has a very poor attitude and has no commitment for \n",
      " \n",
      "Page 5 of 8 \n",
      " \n",
      "clinical work or for educational activities. His interest in doing journal clubs, \n",
      "research and literature surveys was totally unsatisfactory.  \n",
      " \n",
      "6. In your opinion, what do you see as the trainee’s main strengths in \n",
      "his ability to practice at a Consultant level? :- Nothing specific.  \n",
      "7. What weakness do you think the trainee needs to improve on, in \n",
      "order to practice effectively at a consultant level? :- The trainee has \n",
      "numerous weaknesses. I have personally advised the trainee on more than \n",
      "eight occasions over the last two years. None of these attempts made the \n",
      "trainee to improve any of his behavioral problems. As the supervisor, with \n",
      "the intention of improving the weaknesses and changing the behavior, I \n",
      "made a complaint against the trainee to the PGIM about a year ago and got \n",
      "a board appointed to advise the trainee. This also was of no avail. Since \n",
      "recently, the trainee has appeared drowsy in the morning. If he is to practice \n",
      "at a consultant level in Sri Lanka, he should be alert and his personality \n",
      "should be completely reformed.  \n",
      " \n",
      "8. Are there any special matters of concern? :- There were several \n",
      "occasions where Dr. Abeyawickrama gave flimsy excuses to keep away \n",
      "from work. He was noted to fall ill often in the morning hours. Since recently \n",
      "he was noted to be very drowsy to the extent that he is unable to maintain \n",
      "an erect posture, during ward rounds. His drowsiness during ward work \n",
      "was observed by two other Specialists independently. I am with a strong \n",

      "through two professional internship appointments without having anything \n",
      "worth mentioning on record. According to my knowledge, he was noted for \n",
      "the first time during his senior registrar appointment. He appears to be \n",
      "intelligent but with a personality disorder. I feel he needs urgent counseling \n",
      "and recommend him to be seen by a psychiatrist. I earnestly request the \n",
      "Board of Study in Medicine to allocate Dr. Rasantha Abeyawickrama to a \n",

      "“Dr. Abeyawickrama participated in all of the above training activities but \n",
      "was unable to fulfill them to the level expected of a Fellow. For example, he \n",
      "was not able to run the ambulatory clinic session or to perform overnight \n",
      "calls independently as a Neurology Fellow. He required close supervision \n",
      "and was functioning most of the time as an observer in the inpatient setting. \n",
      "He was not able to perform hands-on neurophysiologic studies as the \n",
      "laboratory supervisor did not feel that he was ready to do so. He also \n",

      "Medicine. The Board of Study in Medicine appointed a three-member Committee \n",
      "to study the progress report sent by the overseas trainer. The Committee \n",
      "observed that there was prima facie evidence of professional inadequacy \n",
      "displayed by the Petitioner. Accordingly, the Board of Management decided to \n",
      "appoint a Preliminary Inquiry Committee. The Petitioner failed and neglected to \n",
      "attend the inquiry held on 6-02-2020 stating that the General Regulations and \n",
      "Guidelines issued for 2018 are not applicable to the Petitioner. The Petitioner \n",
      "failed and neglected to attend the re-scheduled inquiry on 05-03-2020 as well. \n",
      "In these circumstances, the Preliminary Inquiry Committee had come to a finding \n",
      "that there was prima facie evidence not to grant the Petitioner Board Certification \n",
      "without further investigation into the matter. The Committee expressed the view \n",
      "that their primary concern was the safety of patients. Accordingly, the Board of \n",
      "Management appointed a Formal Inquiry Committee comprising three members. \n",
      "By that time, the Petitioner has invoked the Writ jurisdiction of this Court in the \n",
      "instant Application.  \n",
      "The Petitioner joined the MD Programme in 2001 where the Handbook and \n",
      "Prospectus 1992 was in force. Clause 10 of the 1992 Handbook and Prospectus \n",
      "reads thus; \n",
      "“The Board of Management of the PGIM reserves the right to modify, alter or \n",
      "totally change any of the rules and regulations in this Prospectus from time \n",
      "to time. In the event such modification, alteration or total change is done, the \n",
      "new rules and regulations will apply.” \n",
      "Accordingly, it is abundantly clear that the General Regulations and Guidelines \n",
      "of 2018 will be applicable to the Petitioner.  \n",
      "It is pertinent to note that the overseas trainer had pointed out several \n",
      "deficiencies in his report. The Board of Study and Board of Management had \n",
      "jointly decided to address these deficiencies by implementing a mechanism for \n",
      "remedial training. It is the duty of the Board of Management to certify the \n",
      "competency and fitness of a postgraduate trainee to be a Specialist, ensuring the \n",
      "delivery of the highest quality of safety and care to the patients. \n",
      "Having scrutinized the evidence presented, it is manifestly clear that the \n",
      "Petitioner’s local and overseas training is unsatisfactory. Adhering to the \n",
      "principles of natural justice,  the PGIM requested the Petitioner to be present \n",
      "before the Committee. However, the Petitioner failed to present himself or make \n",
      "representations before the Committee. If the Petitioner is in possession of any \n",
      "defence or explanation, he would have put forward the same at the Inquiry. \n",
      "Instead, the Petitioner invoked the Writ jurisdiction of this Court. The Petitioner \n",
      " \n",
      "Page 8 of 8 \n",
      " \n",
      "should comply with the request made by the PGIM to be present at the Inquiry \n",
      "and thereafter make this Application. It is apparent that the procedure laid down \n",
      "in General Regulations and Guidelines – 2018 is adopted by the PGIM in respect \n",
      "of the actions taken against the Petitioner.  The PGIM has acted within the \n",
      "purview of existing rules, regulations and laws, and therefore, this Court can not \n",

      "It is important to note that the observations and recommendations made by Dr. \n",

      "President’s Counsel for the Petitioner, suggesting that Dr. Padma Gunaratne \n",
      "submitted an adverse report against the Petitioner due to a personal grudge, is \n",
      "devoid of merit. \n",

      "completed his local and overseas training and therefore, he is not entitled to the \n",
      "appointment as a Consultant Neurologist. The Petitioner has no option but to \n",
      "undergo further local or overseas training as recommended by the PGIM. \n",
      "This Court is mindful of the fact that, when this matter was taken up for \n",
      "argument, at the request of this Court,  the PGIM was amenable to reduce the \n",

      "The case titled \"Dr. Rasantha Sanjeeva Abeywickrama v. Postgraduate Institute of Medicine\" involves a legal dispute where Dr. Rasantha Sanjeeva Abeywickrama sought a Writ of Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus concerning a decision made by the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine (PGIM) that mandated him to undergo remedial training before he could receive Board Certification as a Consultant Neurologist. The court examined the evidence of the Petitioner’s unsatisfactory training performances both locally and internationally and concluded that the procedures instituted by PGIM were in alignment with the applicable regulations. Ultimately, the court dismissed Dr. Abeywickrama's application, indicating that he had not successfully completed the required training and, therefore, was not entitled to the relief he sought. The actions taken by the PGIM were deemed lawful, and there was no evidence of bad faith against the Petitioner.\n",

      "has consented to that arrangement. \n",
      "(d) It is important to note that, as the Financial Controller of the Petitioner \n",

      "which was paid upon his retirement and collected the terminal dues by him \n",

      "(e) The 3rd Respondent knew that what he was agreeing to, was not an 'extension \n",

      "(f) For the periods covered by the fixed-term contracts of employment, the 3rd \n",
      "Respondent is not entitled to gratuity. \n",

      "had been temporarily sealed, and taken to a shop called Beruwala Gem Bureau \n",
      "where the brown-coloured powder detected has been weighed using the \n",
      "electronic scale available in the said shop. The contents had shown a gross \n",

      "container with Heroin, the police party came to the house of the appellant, which \n",
      "was nearby, and arrested the appellant implicating her falsely for the detection.  \n",
      "The witness has denied that the appellant was arrested in the manner suggested \n",
      "by the learned Counsel for the appellant and had insisted that the police party \n",
      "Page 5 of 13 \n",
      " \n",
      "had no reasons to arrest the appellant falsely, and she was arrested only because \n",
      "she had Heroin in her possession.  \n",
      "PW-04 had been another officer who was in the police party and assisted \n",
      "Sergeant Perera in the detection. He has substantiated the evidence given by PW-\n",
      "02 in that regard, and had stated that when the appellant was arrested, she had \n",
      "in her right-hand palm the container which had the quantity of Heroin. In his \n",
      "evidence, he has stated that when the appellant was stopped and searched, \n",
      "Sergeant Perera was assisted by WPC2686 Sandya who was a member of the \n",
      "raiding party. PW-04 also has identified the relevant productions in Court. \n",
      "According to the evidence of PW-02, when the appellant was arrested, he has \n",
      "come to know that the appellant was living in the vicinity, because of the fact \n",
      "that some females from a house  located nearby came to the place of the arrest.  \n",
      "However, the evidence of PW-04 had been that he was unaware where the \n",
      "appellant was living. It has been suggested to PW-04 that the police party never \n",
      "went to a place called Beruwala Gem Bureau for the weighing of the productions. \n",
      "However, the witness had denied that suggestion insisting that it was weighed \n",
      "as stated in the evidence.  \n",
      "During the trial, the appellant has admitted the report prepared by the \n",
      "Government Analyst in relation to the productions sent to the Government \n",
      "Analyst for analysis, and the fact that the report contained that the pure quantity \n",
      "of Heroin found was 3.21 grams.  The appellant also had admitted the production \n",
      "chain. Accordingly, the said admissions had been recorded in terms of section \n",
      "420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.  \n",
      "After the prosecution case was closed, having considered the evidence led against \n",
      "the appellant, the learned High Court Judge has decided to call for a defence \n",
      "from her.  \n",
      "The appellant has made a dock statement. In her dock statement she has taken \n",
      "up the stand that on the date of the incident, she went to her mother’s house \n",
      "Page 6 of 13 \n",
      " \n",
      "and while there, some persons came to the house and called her. When she came \n",
      "out, they identified themselves as police officers and said that they found some \n",
      "drugs in the thicket nearby and arrested her and took her to the Kosgoda police \n",
      "station. She has denied that she had anything in her possession and had claimed \n",
      "innocence of the charge.  \n",
      "The Grounds of Appeal \n",
      "At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated \n",
      "the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court. \n",
      "1. There were inter se contradictions between the evidence of PW-02 and \n",
      "04, and the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider them as \n",
      "relevant.  \n",
      "2. WPC2686 Sandya who was a member of the police party had not been \n",
      "called as a witness, and that creates a doubt as to the prosecution \n",
      "evidence.  \n",
      "3. The probability of the alleged incident as narrated by the witnesses.  \n",
      "4. The learned High Court Judge was misdirected as to the alleged place \n",
      "of arrest.  \n",
      "5. The learned High Court Judge who heard the case remanded the \n",
      "appellant during the trial because she could not bring her Counsel to \n",
      "Court, and she was granted bail only under the directive of the Court \n",
      "of Appeal, which has resulted in a denial of a fair trial towards the \n",
      "appellant. \n",
      "Consideration of The Grounds of Appeal \n",
      "As the grounds of appeal number 1 to 4 are interrelated, I will now proceed to \n",
      "consider them collectively.  \n",
      "However, before considering the said grounds of appeal, I find it appropriate to \n",
      "consider the 5th ground of appeal, where it is alleged that no fair trial was \n",
      "afforded to the appellant as a result of her being remanded during the trial.  \n",
      "Page 7 of 13 \n",
      " \n",
      "I find that the trial of this matter has been commenced on 21-09-2017 and the \n",
      "evidence in chief of PW-02 had been concluded on that day.  \n",
      "Rather than cross-examining the witness, the learned Counsel for the appellant \n",
      "has moved for a date for cross-examination of the witness, which has resulted \n",
      "in the case being postponed to 13-03-2018. However, it is apparent from the case \n",
      "record that the case has gone down several occasions, mainly on applications \n",
      "made on behalf of the appellant, and various Counsel had appeared for her at \n",
      "various times.  \n",
      "The learned High Court Judge, being frustrated of the case being dragged on in \n",
      "this manner has decided to remand the appellant on 01-10-2019 and take  the \n",
      "matter forward. Still, the matter could not be taken up for further trial until 29-\n",
      "06-2020.  \n",
      "During the intervening period, the appellant has filed an application in revision \n",
      "before the Court of Appeal, challenging the learned High Court Judge’s decision  \n",
      "to remand her, and upon a directive from the Court of Appeal, the appellant has \n",
      "been released on the same bail conditions imposed upon her earlier.  \n",
      "The above factual situation clearly provides that although the appellant has been \n",
      "remanded during the pendency of her case, since there was no evidence led \n",
      "during that period, there was no denial of fair trial towards her. Therefore, I am \n",
      "in no position to agree that no fair trial was afforded to her, and do not find merit \n",
      "in the 5th ground of appeal urged by the appellant.  \n",
      "The alleged inter se contradiction the learned Counsel speaks about relates to \n",
      "whether the witnesses knew beforehand the house where the appellant lived. I \n",
      "am unable to find any contradiction in that regard as it is clear that both \n",
      "witnesses have stated the same.  \n",
      "The evidence of the PW-02 had been that neither he nor any other officer who \n",
      "took part in the detection knew where the appellant lived, but assumed that she \n",
      "is living nearby as several persons came out of a house nearby when they \n",
      "Page 8 of 13 \n",
      " \n",
      "arrested the appellant. However, he has given evidence that he knew the area \n",
      "well, being an experienced police officer.  \n",
      "The evidence of PW-04 had been the same, the only difference being that he has \n",
      "not explained any further as to how he assumed where the house of the appellant \n",
      "situated. Probably, because, such a question was not put to the witness by the \n",
      "Counsel who represented the appellant at the trial.  \n",
      "I am unable to find any discrepancy as to the place of arrest as well. The \n",
      "prosecution evidence has been that the appellant was arrested while she was \n",
      "walking suspiciously on the nearby road from the place where the police officers \n",
      "were looking for hidden illicit liquor.  The evidence of the prosecution witnesses \n",
      "had been consistent as to the place of arrest,  \n",
      "I find no basis to conclude that the position taken up by the appellant has  \n",
      "created any doubt as to the place of arrest.  \n",
      "For the reasons considered as above, I find no basis for the 1st  and the 4th \n",
      "grounds of appeal. \n",
      "I will now proceed to consider whether the defence taken up by the appellant has \n",
      "created any doubt as to the prosecution case when the ground of appeal in \n",
      "relation to the probability is considered. \n",
      "It is trite law that the evidence in a case should be considered in its totality and \n",
      "not in its isolation.   \n",
      "In the Privy Council judgement in Jayasena Vs. Queen 72 NLR 313, it was held:  \n",
      "“A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider \n",
      "all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the prosecution or by \n",
      "the defence in its totality without compartmentalizing and, ask himself \n",
      "whether a prudent man, in the circumstances of the particular case, he \n",
      "believes the accused guilty of the charge or not guilty.” \n",
      "Page 9 of 13 \n",
      " \n",
      "The learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the failure of the \n",
      "prosecution to call WPC2686 Sandya who has taken part in the raid as a major \n",
      "drawback for the prosecution’s case. He was of the view that it has created a \n",
      "presumption in terms of section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance that, if called, \n",
      "her evidence would have been contrary to the evidence of the other witnesses as \n",
      "to what really happened. It was his position that this fact in itself creates a \n",
      "reasonable doubt as to the prosecution case.    \n",
      "The view of the learned SSC in this regard was that the prosecution has called \n",
      "the necessary witnesses to prove its case and it is not necessary to call all the \n",
      "witnesses listed in an indictment to prove a case against an accused.  \n",
      "He cited the case of Devundarage Nihal Vs. A.G., S.C. Appeal 154/2010 \n",
      "decided on 03-01-2019 in support of his contention.  \n",
      "The relevant section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance reads thus; \n",
      "134. No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required \n",
      "to the proof of any fact. \n",
      "Considering the relevant section 134 of the Indian Evidence Act which is \n",
      "identical to that of section 134 of our Ordinance, Buwaneka Aluvihare, J. in the \n",

      "observed, \n",
      "“On consideration of the relevant authorities and the provisions of the Indian \n",
      "Evidence Act 1872, the following propositions may be safely stated as firmly \n",
      "established.  \n",
      "1. As a general rule, a Court can and may act on the testimony of a \n",
      "single witness though uncorroborated. One credible witness \n",
      "outweighs the testimony of a number of other witnesses of \n",
      "indifferent character. \n",
      "Page 10 of 13 \n",
      " \n",
      "2. Unless corroboration is insisted upon by statute, Court should not \n",
      "insist on corroboration, except in cases where the nature of the \n",
      "testimony of the single witness itself requires as a rule of \n",
      "prudence, \n",
      "3. Whether corroboration of the testimony of a single witness is or is \n",
      "not necessary, must depend upon the facts and circumstances of \n",
      "each case and no general rule can be laid down in a matter like \n",
      "this and much depends upon the judicial discretion of the Judge \n",
      "before whom the case comes.” \n",
      "In the case of King Vs Chalo Singho 42 NLR 269, Soertsz, J. stated, \n",
      "“It must, therefore, be regarded as well-established law, that a prosecutor \n",
      "is not bound to call all the witnesses on the indictment or to tender them for \n",
      "cross-examination. That is a matter in his discretion. But in exceptional \n",
      "circumstances, a Judge might interfere to ask him to call a witness or to call \n",
      "a witness as a witness of the Court.” \n",

      "Further, it is not incumbent on the trial Judge to direct the jury, save in \n",
      "exceptional circumstances, that they may draw a presumption under section \n",
      "114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance adverse to the prosecution from its failure \n",
      "to call one or more of its witnesses at the trial without calling all. \n",

      "section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance.” \n",
      "In the appeal under consideration, it is not that the prosecution has called a \n",
      "single witness to prove their case. Two police officers who took part in the raid \n",
      "has been called by the prosecution. The mentioned WPC2686 Sandya is not  a \n",
      "listed witness in the indictment. It is clear from the evidence of the witnesses \n",
      "that her contribution to the actual detection was very minimal. When Sergeant \n",
      "Perera wanted the appellant to open her palm and show what she was carrying, \n",
      "initially she has hesitated, it had been the evidence of the witnesses that it was \n",

      "to be considered by taking the evidence, be it of the prosecution or the defence, \n",
      "in its totality, and not by taking portions of evidence in its isolation.  \n",
      "When considering the evidence of the prosecution as a whole, it is clear that they \n",

      "liquor in a thicket behind the railway station. Although they were in civics, the \n",
      "fact that they were police officers may have been visible to any onlookers because \n",
      "of what they were doing at that time. Under such circumstances, the police \n",
      "officers being trained and experienced officers in observing people, it was very \n",
      "much possible for witnesses to suspect the appellant in the way she is alleged to \n",
      "have behaved when passing the police officers who were looking for illicit liquor.  \n",
      "Page 12 of 13 \n",
      " \n",
      "I find that it was quite probable for the witnesses led by Sergeant Perera to \n",
      "pursue the appellant, stop her, and search her. According to the witnesses, when \n",
      "they stopped her, they have observed that she was holding something in her \n",
      "right-hand palm. Upon inspection, it has been found that she is having a film \n",
      "roll container, which was something commonly available during that period as \n",
      "digital camera technology was rare at that time. Such a container is something \n",

      "Although such a quantity may sound small nowadays, in the year 2000, this \n",

      "The evidence of the witnesses as to the place of residence of the appellant is very \n",
      "much probable as against the contention of the appellant, where she states that \n",
      "police officers came to her house and arrested her after finding the drug hidden \n",
      "in the thicket.  \n",
      "I do not see any probability in the version of events taken up by the appellant, \n",
      "as I do not find any reason for a drug trafficker to hide a drug in a thicket after \n",

      "detection took place on the road.  \n",
      "I do not find any basis to conclude that the police party went to the appellant’s \n",
      "house based on a petition received by them. The evidence led in the case does \n",
      "not suggest any basis to believe that receiving a petition was the reason for this \n",

      "police officers were engaged in vice prevention duties, and not having conducted \n",
      "a planned raid in relation to the appellant.  \n",
      "For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that the evidence of the \n",

      "In view of the interpretation provided above under Section 2(4)(a), termination of \n",
      "services of a workman includes non-employment of the workman in such \n",

      "apparent that for the purpose of TEWA, any termination of services including \n",
      "constructive termination of a workman effected in noncompliance of the said \n",
      "Section 2 of TEWA falls within the purview of “termination of employment”.  \n",
      "It is on the common ground that no letters of termination were issued to the 3rd to \n",
      "7th Respondents. It appears that there was no formal documentation supporting the \n",
      "termination of employment of the 3rd to 7th Respondents. Further, there is no \n",
      "agreement on termination of employment among the parties and the reason for the \n",
      "termination is unknown. Hence, the burden is on the 3rd to 7th Respondents to prove \n",
      "that their services have been terminated by the Petitioner.  \n",
      "The 3rd to 7th Respondents complained to the police on 20.09.2018 that they were \n",
      "not allowed to report to duty from 12.09.2018 and their services were terminated. \n",
      "At the inquiry, the 4th Respondent stated that they were prevented from reporting \n",
      "to work, which unequivocally amounted to constructive termination of their \n",
      "services. Thus, it appears that the Petitioner has endeavored to deny the \n",
      "employment for the 3rd to 7th Respondent, temporarily or permanently. In the above \n",
      "premise, the 3rd to 7th Respondents will be compelled to seek relief in terms of \n",

      "are constructively terminated from employment cannot seek relief under the TEWA \n",
      "cannot stand in law. \n",
      "The Petitioner states that the Petitioner Company intended to take disciplinary \n",

      "However, it appears that the Petitioner has not exposed or expressed its intention \n",

      " \n",
      "to take disciplinary actions against the 3rd to 7th Respondents until the Petitioner has \n",

      "produced before the 2nd Respondent to substantiate such a position that the \n",
      "Petitioner had the intention to take any disciplinary actions against the 3rd to 7th \n",
      "Respondents. It appears that the Petitioner has failed to notify the 3rd to 7th \n",
      "Respondents of its intention to take disciplinary actions. No charge sheet had been \n",
      "served against them. Even the Human Resource Manager of the Petitioner Company \n",
      "who had provided a statement to the Police on 20.09.2018 had not indicated any \n",
      "intention of the Petitioner Company to take disciplinary actions against the 3rd to 7th \n",
      "Respondents. A mere statement, not substantiated with any evidence, shall not \n",
      "prove the alleged intention of the Petitioner Company that the Petitioner Company \n",
      "was in the process of taking disciplinary actions against the 3rd to 7th Respondents. \n",
      "It is noteworthy the period of time taken by the Petitioner even to express an \n",
      "intention of conducting an inquiry against the 3rd to 7th Respondents and further such \n",
      "intimation was made only at the later part of the inquiry before the 2nd Respondent. \n",
      "It appears that there was no reason for the 3rd to 7th Respondents to believe that \n",
      "the Petitioner was intending to take disciplinary actions against them.  Therefore, \n",
      "the assertion of the 3rd to 7th Respondents that the Petitioner Company terminated \n",
      "their services by preventing them from reporting to work without any reason and \n",
      "on non-disciplinary grounds cannot be denied. Accordingly, the application made by \n",
      "the 3rd to 7th Respondents to the 1st Respondent cannot be considered a premature \n",
      "application or that it is contrary to the provisions of TEWA. \n",
      "Since there was no disciplinary action taken against the 3rd to 7th   Respondents by \n",
      "the Petitioner, the termination of their services by the Petitioner cannot be \n",
      "considered as a termination on disciplinary grounds. Therefore, the applicability of \n",
      "TEWA in respect of the termination of services of the 3rd to 7th Respondents cannot \n",
      "be denied while the 1st Respondent cannot be ousted from exercising the power \n",
      "vested upon him under TEWA. \n",
      "The Petitioner further claims that the 1st and 2nd Respondent could have made an \n",
      "Order directing the Petitioner Company to hold a disciplinary inquiry with regard to \n",
      "the incident on the very first day of the inquiry. Nevertheless, upon perusal of the \n",
      "proceedings of the inquiry before the 2nd Respondent and the material placed \n",
      "before this Court, it is evident that the Petitioner has not taken up any such stand or \n",

      "disciplinary inquiry by the Petitioner at a later stage of the inquiry before the 2nd \n",

      "entitled to claim that its application to hold a disciplinary inquiry against the 3rd to \n",
      "7th Respondent was not accommodated. \n",
      "Further, the Petitioner submits that, as the 3rd to 7th Respondents claimed that their \n",

The court found that the employees had been constructively terminated as they were not allowed to report to work following an incident of misconduct. The court held that the provisions of the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act (TEWA) were applicable, as there was no formal termination or disciplinary actions initiated by the petitioner. The inquiry conducted determined that the employees were due compensation for wrongful termination, which led to the dismissal of the petitioner's claims. The petition was ultimately dismissed.\"\n",

      "other officers in a white coloured van belonging to the police department.  \n",
      "He had been dressed in number 02 police uniform, while all other officers had \n",
      "been in civics. The team has left the police station on routine crime prevention \n",

      "duty. After traveling to various places, they have come near Babapulle road and \n",

      "After leaving two police officers in the van, PW-01, along with other team \n",
      "members had walked towards the Premadasa International Cricket Stadium. \n",
      "While walking, he has observed a person coming towards him. After seeing him, \n",
      "crossing the road towards the other side pavement, and having suspected the \n",
      "movements of the person, PW-01 and the team has surrounded him.  \n",
      "When searched, PW-01 has found a pink-coloured cellophane bag with some \n",
      "brown-coloured substance in his right-hand side pocket. Through his \n",
      "experience, PW-01 has realized that the substance is Heroin, and arrested the \n",
      "person, namely, Rohana Priyanthage Antony Kumara at 15.10 hours. The \n",
      "witness has identified the suspect arrested as the appellant who stood indicted \n",
      "before the High Court.  \n",
      "After the arrest, PW-01 and his team has gone to a place called  Dedigama \n",
      "Pawning Center in Dematagoda and had used the electronic scale available in \n",
      "the pawning center to weigh the productions. The parcel had shown a weight of \n",
      "20 grams and 30 milligrams. After the weighing, PW-01 has taken steps to seal \n",
      "the productions, and had return to his station. PW-01 has entered his in entry \n",
      "note at 16.25 hours. He has handed over the suspect and the productions to \n",
      "police reserve under production receipt number 163/2014.  \n",
      "The evidence in chief of PW-01 itself shows that the learned State Counsel who \n",
      "prosecuted has questioned the witness as to the duties he performed before he \n",
      "left the station at 14.40 hours. It has been revealed that in fact PW-01 has left \n",
      "the police station at 6.30 hours in the morning for his vice prevention duties. He \n",
      "and his team have arrested 4 suspects including a female, and had returned to \n",
      "the police station at 14.20 hours, which means, PW-01 and his team had left the \n",

      "Kethtarama Stadium and he was arrested in the morning itself when he came in \n",

      "When the appellant was required to present his defence at the close of the \n",
      "prosecution case, he has made a dock statement. It had been his position that \n",
      "in the morning of 22-05-2014, he came in a three-wheeler and got down from it \n",
      "near Kethtarama Stadium to meet a person called Suresh with the intention of \n",
      "obtaining employment, and he was arrested by the police at that point. He has \n",
      "claimed that he was assaulted, although he had nothing in his possession, but \n",
      "later took him to the police station and was charged for having Heroin in his \n",
      "possession. \n",
      "On behalf of the appellant, a person called Ismaldeen has given evidence. He has \n",
      "stated that he took the appellant in his three-wheeler on a hire and when they \n",
      "reached Maligawatta area, four police officers in civilian clothes stopped the \n",
      "vehicle and arrested them, and both of them were assaulted and taken to the \n",
      "Page 6 of 11 \n",

      "omissions in the evidence of PW-01 and 02 with regard to the detection of Heroin \n",

      "productions had been properly sealed, handed over to the police reserve and \n",
      "taken to the Government Analyst in the proper manner.  \n",
      "The Government Analyst Report reveals that the substance found in the \n",

      "Diacetylmorphine, commonly known as Heroin.  \n",
      "The attention of the learned High Court Judge had been drawn to the timeline \n",
      "given by PW-01 and his team about coming to the police station after conducting \n",
      "several raids and leaving again within 20 minutes time. It had been determined \n",
      "that there was no ambiguity in the timeline given by the witnesses as it was \n",
      "probable for the police to complete their necessary duties within 20 minutes  and \n",
      "leave the station.  \n",
      "The learned High Court Judge has determined that the stand taken by the \n",

      "was called upon for the defence, were different to each other, and had determined \n",

      "Page 7 of 11 \n",
      " \n",
      "The learned President’s Counsel formulated the following ground of appeal for \n",
      "the consideration of the Court.  \n",
      "(1) The learned High Court Judge misdirected himself of the facts of the \n",
      "case by failing to properly analyze the evidence.  \n",
      "In his submissions the learned President’s Counsel brought  to the notice of the \n",
      "Court the that for a team of police officers who left their police station at 6.30 in \n",
      "the morning, and returned at 14.20 in the afternoon with 4 arrested persons, to \n",
      "leave the station in 20 minutes time after completing the necessary formalities \n",
      "that should be fulfilled in relation to the 4 arrested persons, is highly improbable.  \n",
      "He was of the view that if the learned High Court Judge looked at the \n",
      "improbability factor in that relation in the correct perspective, there was no basis \n",
      "to conclude that the charges have been proved beyond reasonable doubt against \n",
      "the appellant.  \n",
      "Although the learned President’s Counsel made his submissions based on \n",
      "several other factors he termed as weaknesses in the prosecution case, I will \n",
      "proceed to consider all the factors on the basis of probability, as it was the main \n",
      "ground of appeal urged on behalf of the appellant.  \n",
      "It was the submission of the Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG)  that the \n",
      "arrest of the appellant by the police was not a disputed fact, and since there were \n",
      "no omissions or contradictions as to the evidence for the prosecution, it has been \n",
      "established that the arrest was made in the afternoon and not as claimed by the \n",
      "appellant.  \n",
      "It was the position of the learned SDSG that the improbability factor as claimed \n",
      "by the learned President’s Counsel had drawn the attention of the learned High \n",
      "Court Judge, and since the learned High Court Judge had considered the facts \n",
      "and the relevant law in its correct perspective before reaching his conclusions, \n",
      "the appeal should stand dismissed.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Page 8 of 11 \n",
      " \n",
      "Consideration of the Ground of Appeal \n",
      "It is clear from the evidence of PW-01 that he and his team of police officers had \n",
      "initially left the Colombo Crimes Division at 6.30 a.m. for their daily vice \n",
      "prevention duties. According to the witness, they have returned to the station at \n",
      "14.20 hours and had left again in 20 minutes time at 14.40 hours. It has been \n",
      "established that the PW-01 has entered his in entry note at 14.20, which means \n",
      "that he has begun to write the entry note at that time. When they returned to \n",
      "the station at 14.20, the police team has had in their custody, four suspects, \n",
      "including a female. Three of them had been arrested for having Cannabis in their \n",
      "possession while the female had been arrested for having Heroin with her.  \n",
      "The question before this Court is whether it would have been possible for the \n",
      "PW-01 to follow all the necessary formalities once an arrested suspect is brought \n",
      "to a police station, especially, with productions relating to drugs, and leave the \n",
      "police station within 20 minutes, again on vice prevention duties.  \n",
      "As I have stated before, when the witness says that he returned to the police \n",
      "station at 14.20 hours, it is clear that it was the time he began to prepare his in \n",
      "entry note in the relevant book. There is no doubt that after having arrested four \n",
      "persons, it will at least take few minutes time for him to obtain the relevant book \n",
      "and enter the notes. Then thereafter, he needs to hand over the four accused \n",
      "persons and the productions to the police reserve, each one separately. It is hard \n",
      "to believe that such a procedure can be completed within a short span of 20 \n",
      "minutes as claimed by the witness. Each production has to be entered in the \n",
      "production register. The Production Officer has to accept the productions after \n",
      "checking the relevant seals. If the suspected persons had any personal \n",
      "belongings, such belongings need to be entered separately and handed over to \n",
      "the Productions Officer.  \n",

      " \n",

      "It is only thereafter, the PW-01 will have time to organize another outing on crime \n",

      "make sure that they do not carry unwanted items and also to search the vehicle \n",
      "they were traveling before leaving for their duties. A police team who returned to \n",
      "a police station after several hours of crime prevention duties needs at least few \n",
      "minutes rest before they embark on another journey of crime prevention.  \n",
      "It is very much apparent that even the prosecuting State Counsel had a doubt \n",
      "in his mind as to the timeline given by PW-01 in this regard when the witness \n",
      "was examined in detail of this fact.  \n",
      "Although it is correct to say that this fact had drawn the attention of the learned \n",
      "High Court Judge, I am not in a position to accept the justification given in that \n",

      "The raiding party has left the police station at 8.20 p.m. and had reached the \n",

      "After the detection and the arrest, the police party has taken steps to take the \n",

      "test, the 5 parcels have shown positive results for Heroin at the Chilaw police \n",

      "Page 6 of 12 \n",
      " \n",
      "productions have been sealed at the Chilaw police station and handed over to \n",
      "the police reserve after following the due procedure. \n",
      "The position taken on behalf of the appellant had been that he had nothing to \n",
      "do with the offence, but he was  an innocent person arrested without any basis. \n",
      "The witness has refused that contention, stating that the appellant was the only \n",
      "person who was arrested at the time of the detection of the drugs.  \n",
      "The officer who took over the productions from the raiding party led by IP \n",
      "Fernando namely, Police Sergeant 19507 Ekanayake (PW-11), has given evidence \n",
      "in this trial and has confirmed that IP Fernando handed over the productions to \n",
      "him along with 4 suspects while he was on police reserve duty at the Chilaw \n",
      "police station.  \n",
      "During the trial, the parties have admitted the chain of productions from taking \n",

      "conducted investigations to identify the productions sent for analysis to the \n",
      "Government Analyst department. She has taken steps to weigh the 5 parcels \n",
      "which contained a substance suspected to be Heroin under proper lab \n",
      "conditions. The substance contained in the parcel marked J-1 had a weight of \n",
      "506 grams, the parcel marked J-2 had a substance weighing 502 grams. The \n",
      "parcel marked J-3 had a substance weighing 501 grams, parcel marked J-4 had \n",
      "a substance weighing 500 grams, and the parcel marked J-5 had a substance \n",
      "weighing 502 grams. The Government Analyst has well explained the reasons for \n",
      "the weight difference mentioned in the said parcels forwarded to the Government \n",
      "Analyst stating that when such a quantity is weighed under normal conditions, \n",
      "the weight difference of such a nature can invariably occur due to various \n",
      "factors.  \n",
      "Page 7 of 12 \n",
      " \n",
      "The Government Analyst Report has been marked as P-12 and it has been \n",
      "established that the 5 parcels contained a pure quantity of 1110 grams of \n",
      "Diacetylmorphine or Heroin.  \n",
      "When the appellant and the other accused were called upon for their defence at \n",
      "the conclusion of the prosecution case, the appellant has made a dock \n",
      "statement. He has claimed that while he was sleeping, he heard a noise, and \n",
      "when he went to inquire, he was apprehended and taken away and he is unaware \n",
      "of anything.  \n",
      "The Grounds of Appeal \n",
      "At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated \n",
      "the following grounds of appeal for consideration of the Court. \n",
      "1. The learned High Court Judge was misdirected by failing to consider \n",
      "that the prosecution did not prove the ingredients of the charges \n",
      "against the appellant based on true facts. \n",
      "2. Without prejudice to the above, learned High Court Judge misdirected \n",
      "that the 1st accused-appellant along with the 5th and the 7th accused \n",
      "had been identified at the time of the detection, yet the 5th and the 7th \n",
      "accused were acquitted which creates a doubt as to the credibility of \n",
      "the evidence.  \n",
      "3. The learned High Court Judge was misdirected by failing to scrutinize \n",
      "the credibility of PW-03 based on principles and established law of the \n",
      "country.  \n",
      "Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal \n",
      "As the three grounds of appeal are interrelated, I will now proceed to consider \n",
      "the said grounds together.  \n",
      "This is a matter where the police officer who conducted and led a team of police \n",
      "officers in the raid has not given evidence due to the fact of him being deceased \n",
      "at the time the evidence was led before the High Court. Instead, it has been the \n",
      "Page 8 of 12 \n",
      " \n",
      "PW-03, who was a member of the raiding party, and a person who could speak \n",
      "about the events that took place on that night, who has given evidence.  \n",
      "The evidence of PW-03 had been that, while waiting on the beach expecting the \n",
      "event informed by the informant, they were able to witness a large boat \n",
      "approaching the shore, and when it was about 200 meters away in the sea, \n",
      "another smaller boat approached it and a sack was transferred to the small boat.  \n",
      "The learned Counsel for the appellant has contended that it would not have been \n",
      "possible for a person who is waiting in hiding more than 200 meters away to \n",
      "observe what was happening in the manner stated by the witness.  \n",
      "The explanation of the witness had been that the date of the incident was a Poya \n",
      "day and therefore, they could observe what was taking place with the aid of the \n",
      "moonlight. During the argument of this matter, the learned Deputy Solicitor \n",
      "General (DSG) who represented the respondent brought to the notice of the Court \n",
      "that, in fact, the mentioned 19-06-1997 was a full moon Poya day. The evidence \n",
      "of PW-03 had been not that he identified the persons engaged in the transaction, \n",
      "but was able only to see that a sack being transferred to the smaller boat, which \n",
      "can be possible to see under such light conditions. Hence, I am unable to find a \n",
      "basis to doubt the evidence of PW-03 in the manner he observed what was \n",
      "happening 200 meters away at the sea.  \n",
      "According to the evidence, when the smaller boat reached the beach, the police \n",
      "party could only apprehend the appellant and the other two occupants of the \n",
      "boat has managed to run away before the police party could reach the boat. In \n",
      "my view, this is quite possible since for a police officer who is waiting on the \n",
      "beach in a concealed position will need at least a minute or two to reach a boat \n",
      "coming on shore, which provides an opportunity for a person who is knowingly \n",
      "engaging in an illegal act and also being persons having a  sound knowledge of \n",
      "the conditions of the area to escape in the manner mentioned by the witness. \n",
      "This is the very reason why the witness has stated in his evidence that he came \n",
      "to know about the identities of the two persons escaped subsequently. If the \n",
      "Page 9 of 12 \n",
      " \n",
      "witness was not telling the truth, he could have very well stated that he was able \n",
      "to identify the 5th and the 7th accused before they escaped from being arrested. \n",
      "It appears from the judgement that one of the reasons for the acquittal of the \n",
      "said accused persons by the learned High Court Judge had been the fact that \n",
      "the said accused had been apprehended some months after the incident, and \n",
      "the failure of the witness to identify them at the time of their escape.  \n",
      "The learned Counsel for the appellant raised the discrepancy as to the weight of \n",
      "the 5 parcels taken over by the police as given in the initial report and when \n",
      "weighed by the Government Analyst as a reason to doubt the credibility of the \n",
      "detection.  \n",
      "The evidence led at the trial clearly establishes that after the detection, the five \n",
      "parcels had been taken to a bakery nearby and weighed with the aid of the scale \n",
      "available at the bakery. No need to say that such a weighing may not produce \n",
      "the exact weight of a content like Heroin. When the 5 parcels were weighed at \n",
      "laboratory conditions using very accurate scales, a difference has been observed \n",
      "as to the weight given in the list of productions sent to the Government Analyst \n",
      "and their actual weight. The Government Analyst has well explained the reasons \n",
      "for the weight difference. This Court is of the view that a difference of such a \n",
      "nature can occur, given the facts and the circumstances relevant to the case \n",
      "under consideration, which would not create any doubt as to the weight of the \n",
      "productions found during the raid.  \n",
      "The evidence of PW-03 had been that these five parcels were recovered inside a \n",
      "fertilizer sack among the fishing nets that were found in the boat. The witness \n",
      "has observed a sack being transferred to the boat from another larger boat about \n",
      "200 meters away from the beach. When the smaller boat reached the shore, there \n",
      "had been two other occupants other than the appellant and the said two persons \n",
      "has escaped before the police could reach them. It is therefore clear that all three \n",
      "of them including the appellant knew that they were bringing in this \n",
      "consignment of drugs.  \n",
      "Page 10 of 12 \n",
      " \n",
      "There is no basis for any argument that the quantity of drugs found was not in \n",
      "the possession of the appellant and he was unaware of what was being \n",
      "transported.  \n",
      "Another position taken up by the learned Counsel for the appellant was that \n",
      "there was only one witness called by the prosecution to prove the charge against \n",
      "the appellant and the evidence was not good enough to prove the charges beyond \n",
      "reasonable doubt against him.  \n",
      "It is well-settled law that it is not the quantity but the quality that matters in a \n",
      "criminal trial.  \n",
      "The relevant section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance reads thus, \n",
      "134. No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required \n",
      "for the proof of any fact. \n",
      "In this case, it is clear that the Police Inspector who led the raid had not been \n",
      "called as a witness because he was deceased. Under the circumstances, it needs \n",
      "to be considered whether the evidence of PW-03 has provided sufficient proof \n",
      "beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who committed the crime \n",
      "mentioned in the indictment. If the Court can come to such a finding, calling and \n",
      "relying on a single witness to establish the facts does not mean that the \n",
      "prosecution has failed to prove its case.  \n",
      "I do not find merit in the argument that the prosecution has failed to prove the \n",
      "time of the arrest as PW-03 was not there when IP Fernando arrested the \n",
      "appellant. It is clear from the evidence that PW-03 after seeing the two other \n",
      "occupants of the boat fleeing from the scene has pursued them. It was IP \n",
      "Fernando who has arrested the appellant, and when PW-03 returned, the \n",
      "appellant was under police custody.  \n",
      "The evidence led in the trial clearly establishes that this detection has taken \n",
      "place sometime after 11.00 p.m. on 19-06-1997. The evidence also clearly \n",
      "establishes the fact that the raiding party had to wait some hours on the beach \n",
      "Page 11 of 12 \n",
      " \n",
      "expecting the transaction to take place, which shows that the incident had \n",
      "occurred in the early hours of 20-06-1997.  \n",
      "Under the circumstances, it is my considered view that the exact time of arrest \n",
      "in precise terms going by the clock is not a necessary factor that has to be \n",
      "established in order to prove the charges against the appellant.  \n",
      "During his evidence, PW-03 has been allowed to go through the notes on the raid \n",
      "prepared by IP Fernando only in order to give evidence as to the weights of the 5 \n",
      "parcels recovered during the raid as it was IP Fernando who has taken down \n",
      "notes in that regard.  \n",
      "In terms of section 159(2) of the Evidence Ordinance, such action is permitted \n",
      "and well within the law.  \n",
      "For better understanding, I will now reproduce the relevant section 159 in its \n",
      "totality. \n",
      "159. (1) A witness may, while under examination, refresh his memory \n",
      "by referring to any writing made by himself at the time of the \n",
      "transaction concerning which he is questioned or so soon afterwards \n",
      "that the Court considers it likely that the transaction was at that \n",
      "time fresh in his memory.  \n",
      "(2) The witness may also refer to any such writing made by any other \n",
      "person, and read by the witness within the time aforesaid, if when he \n",
      "read it he knew it to be correct. \n",

      "The Court of Appeal case CPA/0135/2022 arose from a revision application concerning the dismissal of charges against the accused, Hikgoda Gamage Niroshan Dhananjaya, by the High Court of Colombo. The complaint stemmed from allegations of bribery under the Bribery Act, specifically for soliciting and accepting gratification for issuing a permit to cut down a Jak tree. The High Court discharged the respondent due to a procedural defect—specifically the failure of all three commissioners of the Bribery Commission to sign off on the directive to investigate the complaint.\n",
      "During the appeal, it was argued that all three commissioners’ approval was unnecessary for initiating an investigation, as powers can be exercised by committee members individually. The Court of Appeal referenced precedents and legislative intent in its deliberation, concluding that the requirement for all commissioners to authorize the investigation was overly restrictive and not aligned with the statutory purpose of expedient investigations into bribery allegations.\n",

      "In the case CA Writ Application No: 505/2021, Ekanayake Mudiyanselage Heen Manike and Venerable Mahanuwara Sugathasiri (Petitioners) challenged the decision of the Moratuwa Municipal Council (1st Respondent) to demolish their premises, claiming it was an unauthorized structure encroaching on public land. The Petitioners asserted their legal ownership and long-term occupancy of the land, while the Respondents contended the structure obstructed a public road.\n",
      "The Court examined the relevant sections of the Municipal Council Ordinance, particularly Section 73(1), which grants councils the authority to demand documentation for property claims where obstructions are suspected. The judges ruled that the Council acted within its powers, as the demolition was based on the assertion of an unauthorized structure obstructing public use.\n",
      "Despite the Petitioners’ arguments regarding their ownership and the demolition's legality, the Court found that the remedies sought, including restitution and compensation for damages, were futile as the property was already demolished. Further, the Court concluded that the Petitioners had an alternative civil remedy to address their claims and thus dismissed the Writ Application without costs.\n",
      "Final Decision: The Writ Application was dismissed, affirming the actions taken by the Municipal Council were lawful.\n",

      "2. The findings of the learned High Court Judge on material points \n",

      "Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal \n",
      "As the 1st and the 2nd grounds of appeal urged are interrelated, I will now proceed \n",
      "to consider the said grounds together.  \n",
      "The learned Counsel for the appellant made submissions on the basis that if the \n",
      "incident occurred on a rough surface as admitted by the witnesses in their \n",
      "evidence, there should have been more injuries observed by the doctor who \n",
      "examined the child, and that is a factor that should have been considered in \n",

      " \n",

      " \n",
      " \n",
      "However, the learned High Court Judge, rather than looking at that probability \n",
      "factor in favour of the appellant, has decided that in favour of the prosecution \n",
      "by coming into various surmises and conjectures. It was his view that there was \n",
      "no basis for the learned High Court Judge to come to such findings based on the \n",
      "evidence led in this trial.  \n",
      "He submitted that, even the police evidence as to the observation made in \n",
      "relation to the place of the incident has established the fact that an incident of \n",
      "this nature cannot happen without any visible injuries to a victim.  \n",
      "It is correct to say that the victim child has received no injuries as established \n",
      "by the medical evidence. The doctor has clearly opined an incident of this nature \n",
      "can happen without visible injuries or marks. It is an admitted fact that the land \n",
      "on which this incident has occurred is a land with a rocky terrain and a \n",
      "cinnamon growth. The police officer who recorded his observations as to the \n",
      "place of the crime has observed fallen cinnamon leaves in the place shown as \n",
      "the place where the incident occurred.  \n",
      "As pointed out correctly by the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG), the \n",
      "evidence of the victim child had been that the appellant carried her to the place \n",
      "of the sexual assault and made her to lie down, removed her panty, lifted the \n",
      "school uniform she was wearing and committed this sexual abuse act on her. \n",
      "This clearly establishes the fact that although it may be a rough surface, it was \n",
      "a surface laid with dead leaves. The evidence also shows that the assailant could \n",
      "not complete his intended sexual assault in full. He has bolted from the place \n",
      "after hearing the mother of the victim.  \n",
      "The victim child’s evidence had been that the appellant managed to place his \n",
      "penis on her vagina only once, and ran away upon hearing her mother calling \n",
      "her. This establishes the fact that although the victim child has stated she \n",
      "struggled to escape from him after she was laid down on the ground, the actions \n",
      "of the appellant had taken place during a time period of may be few seconds.  \n",
      "Page 10 of 15 \n",
      " \n",

      "The possibility of receiving any bruises or abrasions as a result of her being \n",

      "highly improbable given the facts and the circumstances.  \n",
      "I am in no position to agree that this is a factor that should have been considered \n",

      "and 28 of the judgement (page 257 and 258 of the appeal brief) has well \n",
      "considered this aspect in coming to her findings in that regard.  \n",
      "The learned High Court Judge has well considered the evidence of the victim \n",
      "child and that of her mother who has come to the scene of the crime while it was \n",
      "happening. According to the evidence of the victim child, it was only because of \n",
      "the mother’s arrival, the appellant ran away after releasing the grip he had on \n",
      "her. The mother’s evidence had been that when she was calling for the child, she \n",
      "came running towards her from the direction of the cinnamon growth. When \n",
      "asked what happened, the child has revealed what happened to her. The mother \n",
      "has then seen the appellant running away. The evidence of both the witnesses \n",
      "clearly establishes that all these events had occurred in quick succession,  which \n",
      "shows that the mother seeing the appellant running away from the scene of the \n",
      "crime is highly probable.  \n",
      "The learned High Court Judge has clearly considered the alleged discrepancies \n",
      "and omissions in relation to the evidence. The mother has stated in her evidence \n",
      "that her daughter told her that after removing her panty, the appellant spit on \n",
      "her vagina and committed the sexual abuse on her. The mother’s evidence had \n",
      "been that when she examined her daughter’s private part, she saw something \n",
      "whitish in colour in her daughter’s vagina. However, the victim child had not \n",
      "stated anything in her evidence about spitting on her private part by the \n",
      "appellant. It needs to be noted that as considered very correctly by the learned \n",
      "High Court Judge, the victim child was around 9 years old when this incident \n",
      "occurred. She has given evidence more than 4 years after the incident. \n",
      "Page 11 of 15 \n",
      " \n",
      "Considering the harrowing experience as narrated by PW-01, her ability to \n",
      "narrate everything what happened after more than 4 years cannot be expected \n",
      "as of a photographic memory.  \n",
      "On the other hand, it can be safely assumed that PW-02, the mother of the \n",
      "victim, being a much elderly person who may have a better capacity to narrate \n",
      "what she was told by her daughter, was telling the truth in that regard in her \n",

      "matter when she examined her child.  \n",
      "Another matter which has drawn the attention of the learned High Court Judge \n",
      "and contended during the hearing of this appeal was the timeline given by the \n",

      "When she returned home, her parents and other siblings were not at home. She \n",

      "mother.  \n",
      "According to the evidence of the mother, it was her habit to return home before \n",
      "her child comes home for the day after school around 2.00 – 2.30 p.m. The \n",
      "mother says that, on this particular day, she received a call from her younger \n",
      "daughter’s kindergarten teacher, informing her the necessity to attend the \n",
      "funeral of a relative of a staff member. Her evidence clearly provides that she has \n",
      "returned home earlier than usual with the intention of attending the said funeral. \n",
      "She has seen her daughter’s shoes and the bag in front of their house, which \n",
      "clearly indicates that the daughter has come home earlier than usual, which has \n",

      "2) Ordinarily, so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The witness \n",
      "could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an element \n",
      "of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to be \n",
      "attuned to absorb the details.   \n",
      "3) Ordinarily, a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the sequence \n",

      "Another matter that needs consideration is whether the victim child and her \n",

      "membership due to the purported reason of encroaching the upper portion of the \n",

      "of the Commissioner-General of Agrarian Development contained in the impugned letter \n",
      "(in the said case) dated 14.06.2021, marked P9.  The Commissioner- General by such letter \n",
      "has decided to call for information in view of taking future steps to evict any unauthorized \n",
      "occupants (vide- order dated 22.03.2022 marked ‘P24’- annexed to the Counter Affidavit). \n",
      "This Court has refused the said application because the Petitioners were unable to establish \n",
      "that their rights had been affected due to the said impugned letter. In any case, the said \n",
      "impugned letter reflects the fact that the Commissioner-General has not yet decided on the \n",
      "purported unauthorized occupation of the upper portion of the Nilanthattuwa tank, which \n",
      "is the basis for the Organisation's denial of the 4th Petitioner's membership. Thus, I observe \n",
      "that the refusal to grant such membership did not stem from any issue relating to the \n",
      "criteria that need to be met in order to be eligible for membership in the Organisation.  \n",
      "Apart from the claims that the 4th Petitioner is occupying the upper part of the said tank \n",
      "without authorization, the 1st and 4th Petitioners are accused of something else based on \n",
      "their respective vocations. The 1st to 4th Respondents contend that the 1st Petitioner is a \n",

      "of them meets the requirement of being a \"farmer\" which is allegedly a requisite for \n",
      "membership. In terms of section 43(4)(c) engaging in agricultural activities in the area of \n",

      "the reigning Monarch participated or provided patronage in agricultural activities to \n",
      "ensure the prosperous island nation was self-sufficient. Hence, it is my view that \n",
      "irrespective of social status or vocation, any individual should be at liberty to engage in \n",
      "Page 7 of 8 \n",
      " \n",
      "agricultural activities and therefore, I find it hard to accept that having mud on one's body \n",
      "all the time is a requirement to be recognized as a \"farmer\". Accordingly, the words “a \n",
      "person whose livelihood is agriculture”, embodied in section 43(4) of the Act should not \n",
      "be interpreted to deprive a person who earns remuneration as a result of a post or position \n",
      "he held at a different forum other than the paddy field. The Petitioners have tendered to \n",
      "this Court two certificates marked ‘C’ and ‘D’ (annexed to the motion dated 18.09.2023) \n",
      "awarded to the 4th Petitioner recognizing him as the 'most outstanding coconut grower' in \n",
      "the respective area.  \n",
      "At the same time, the Petitioners plead that the 4th Petitioner is also the tenant cultivator \n",
      "of the paddy field which forms part of the agricultural land relevant to the instant \n",
      "Application. It is further pleaded that the 4th Petitioner manages and administers the \n",
      "cultivation of his own rubber and coconut plantations and he is passionate about scientific \n",
      "agriculture and interested in investing in scientific methods for increasing the yield from \n",
      "agricultural plantations.  \n",
      "Similarly, it is observed that in terms of section 43 of the Act establishing ownership of \n",
      "agricultural land is not a precondition to becoming eligible for membership of the \n",
      "Organisation. Conversely, obtaining membership in a Farmers' Organisation should not \n",
      "be an added qualification to establish a title.  I arrive at the above findings considering the \n",
      "scheme of the Act. Based on the circumstances of this case, this Court should not engage \n",
      "in an exercise to examine the title to the lands grown by the Petitioners or the relationship \n",
      "between the 4th Petitioner and the other Petitioners.  What needs to be considered in the \n",
      "instant Application is whether the 4th Petitioner is entitled to be a Member of the \n",
      "Organisation simply because the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Development after \n",
      "an appropriate inquiry expressed a decision only in favour of the 4th Petitioner. Moreover, \n",
      "this Court does not have to assess the validity of the Powers of Attorney filed along with \n",
      "the instant Application since a valid proxy on behalf of the 4th Petitioner exists in the \n",
      "docket. The prayer of the Petition also categorically seeks relief only in favour of the 4th \n",
      "Petitioner and/or the 1st Petitioner.  \n",
      "Hence, I take the view that the reasons extended by the 1st to 4th Respondents denying the \n",
      "membership to the 4th Petitioner cannot be considered lawful and it violates the basic rights \n",
      "of the 4th Petitioner. Furthermore, not conferring the membership of the Organisation to \n",
      "the 4th Petitioner by the 1st to 4th Respondents should be considered as an act that prevents \n",
      "Page 8 of 8 \n",
      " \n",
      "giving due effect to the relevant provisions of the said Act. Therefore, I find that only the \n",
      "4th Petitioner is entitled to a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus, but I am not \n",
      "inclined to issue any other reliefs as prayed for in the Prayer of the Petition.  \n",
